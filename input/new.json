  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Token Expiration Bypass due to a logic flaw in `expiresAt` verification. The token validation logic incorrectly bypasses expiration checks when `authInfo.expiresAt` is set to `0`, as the condition `!authInfo.expiresAt` evaluates to false, skipping the expiration validation entirely. This flaw allows tokens with an expiration time of `0`, which should be interpreted as expired or invalid, to be accepted as valid. An attacker could exploit this by crafting or reusing a token with `expiresAt: 0` to bypass intended expiration controls, gaining unauthorized persistent access to protected resources.",
