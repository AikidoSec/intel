  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package do not enforce secure default server settings. When running locally, the server binds to all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) instead of restricting access to `localhost` (`127.0.0.1`). This increases the risk of exposure to external access and makes the application more susceptible to DNS rebinding attacks. The patch addresses this by setting `localhost` as the default bind address, thereby reducing the attack surface.",
