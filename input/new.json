  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package contain undefined behavior in an `asm!` block enabled via the optional `asm` feature on ARMv8 targets. The inline assembly incorrectly specifies operand types as `in` for values and pointers that are mutated within the assembly block. Although this mis-specification does not change the generated assembly in current compiler versions, it constitutes undefined behavior and may introduce potential memory safety risks in future compiler implementations.",
