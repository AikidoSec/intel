  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package allowed persistent file download URLs under `/api/v1/file/` to be indexed by search engines because no crawler restrictions were in place. As a result, sensitive or private files could become discoverable via search queries, since nothing prevented well-behaved crawlers from indexing the 302 redirect targets. An attacker could simply use search engine dorks or automated indexing tools to discover exposed download URLs and retrieve files without needing to guess or brute-force identifiers, leading to unintended data disclosure.",
