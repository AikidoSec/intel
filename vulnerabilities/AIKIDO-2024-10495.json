  "tldr": "Affected versions of the `fluent.fluent-bit` plugin are vulnerable to a use-after-free bug in the `flb_plugin_load_config_file` function. This issue occurs while loading plugins from a configuration file and was introduced in version 3.2.0 with the addition of YAML support. A use-after-free vulnerability arises when a program continues to use memory that has already been freed, potentially leading to undefined behavior, memory corruption, or exploitation.",
