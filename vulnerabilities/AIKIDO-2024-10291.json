  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package may expose sensitive information due to improper enforcement of access policies in a polymorphic model hierarchy. Both the base and concrete models in the hierarchy can have access policies, but the access policies directly defined on the concrete models are not properly enforced. As a result, fields that should be excluded, may still be returned, as those marked with `@omit` on the concrete models, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
