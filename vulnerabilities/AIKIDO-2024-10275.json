  "tldr" : "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to eval injection. The `statsmodels` library uses a string-based formula language from <a href=\"https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formulas.html#the-formula-language\">patsy</a>. Suppose you have a formula like: \"y ~ (a + b + c + d) ** 2\" and create a template where you replace y with {y}. In this case the value that ends up in {y} in the final string is directly controlled by the user. It is quite easily exploitable as shown in the snippet below:\n> ipython\nIN [0]: import statsmodels.formula.api as smf\nIn [1]: mod = smf.ols(formula=\"print('cucu')\", data={}) \ncucu\n...\nValueError: negative dimensions are not allowed",

  "how_to_fix" : "There is no fix at the moment. Owners are laying the responsibility with the user. When you keep using this library, be very careful with the values you pass through the `statsmodels` library.",
