  "tldr": "The affected versions use a polynomial-time regular expression within the `moveSpaces` function, which can lead to performance issues when processing specially crafted input. Specifically, the regular expression exhibits **catastrophic backtracking**, where certain patterns cause the regex engine to perform excessive computations. An attacker could exploit this by supplying input that triggers worst-case performance, leading to high CPU usage and making the application vulnerable to **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)** attacks. This type of vulnerability can degrade system performance or make the application temporarily unavailable.",
