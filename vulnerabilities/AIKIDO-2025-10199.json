  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an open redirect in the `getSafeRedirect` method due to improper input validation. The method fails to correctly escape, normalize, or encode URLs before processing redirects, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious URL that redirects users to phishing or malicious sites. This can deceive users into visiting unintended domains under the guise of a legitimate link.",
