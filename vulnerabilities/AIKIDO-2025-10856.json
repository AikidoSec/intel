  "tldr": "Affected versions are vulnerable to a validation bypass in UserBadge identifier normalization. The issue occurs because the UserBadge constructor validates that the identifier is not empty and does not exceed `MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH`. Still, when using `$identifierNormalizer`, the normalized identifier is computed lazily in `getUserIdentifier()` without validation, allowing normalizers to return invalid values. An attacker can exploit this by supplying a custom normalizer that returns an empty string or other invalid identifiers, bypassing the constructor's validation and potentially leading to authentication flaws.",
