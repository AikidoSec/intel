  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to improper certificate validation when connecting to a MariaDB server. Specifically, the `servername` parameter is not properly validated during the TLS handshake, resulting in a failure to verify the server's identity. This flaw allows attackers with a valid certificate for a different hostname to impersonate the server, potentially enabling man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.",
