  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package rely on a vulnerable version of the `LibTiff` library in their source files. Specifically, `tif_write.c` in `LibTiff` version 4.0.6 contains a flaw in the error-handling code path of the `TIFFFlushData1()` function. This function fails to reset the `tif_rawcc` and `tif_rawcp` members properly, leading to a heap buffer overflow. This vulnerability may result in memory corruption and potential exploitation by attackers.",
