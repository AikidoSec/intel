  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Unlimited Resource Consumption due to inefficient parsing in the Lambda runtime. The Lambda contains a vulnerability (CVE-2024-45338) that allows an attacker to craft specially designed input for the `Parse` functions, causing non-linear processing relative to input length. This can lead to extremely slow parsing, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).",
