  "tldr": "`net-imap` is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) through memory exhaustion in its response parser. A malicious server can send highly compressed `uid-set` data at any time while the client is connected, which the client's receiver thread automatically processes. The response parser uses `Range#to_a` to expand `uid-set` data into arrays of integers without any limit on the expanded size, potentially leading to excessive memory consumption.",
