  "tldr": "Affected versions are vulnerable to Path Traversal due to insufficient validation in `TransferManager.downloadManyFiles()`, allowing attackers to write files outside the intended download directory. The issue occurs because object names were not properly checked for absolute paths or traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`). This has been fixed by enforcing strict path containment checks, rejecting absolute paths, and ensuring all resolved paths remain within the designated base directory.",
