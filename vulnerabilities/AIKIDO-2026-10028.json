  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package may expose uninitialized memory due to a flaw in Node.js buffer allocation when allocations are interrupted while using the `vm` module with the `timeout` option. Under specific timing conditions, buffers created via `Buffer.alloc` or TypedArray instances such as `Uint8Array` may contain residual data from previous operations, potentially leaking in-process secrets like tokens or passwords or causing data corruption.",
