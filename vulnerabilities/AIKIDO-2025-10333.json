  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to the exposure of sensitive data in logs due to improper handling of decryption in the Kustomize controller. This issue occurs when a secret resource is initially set to an empty string in the base layer and later updated with actual secret data. As a result, the controller mistakenly decrypts and logs the secret value. If the controller publicly logs are exposed or kept in a system with less authorization, an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data.",
