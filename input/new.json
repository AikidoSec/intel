  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to duplicate transaction attacks in Solana payment flows because identical transaction payloads can be generated under concurrent conditions. Since Solana rejects byte-identical transactions within the same blockhash window, attackers or high-throughput scenarios could trigger transaction collisions, leading to dropped or delayed payments. The issue is fixed by adding a unique memo with a random nonce to each transaction, ensuring every payment is distinct and preventing duplicate transaction conflicts.",
