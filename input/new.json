The obfuscated malicious code, located in `lib/util/support.js`, activates a Monero cryptocurrency miner without user consent. This issue is resolved in versions 2.13.6, 3.6.16, and 4.9.15, where the malicious code has been removed. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to a secure version to mitigate this risk.",
