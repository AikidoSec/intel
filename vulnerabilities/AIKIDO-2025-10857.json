  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to injection attacks due to overly permissive regular expressions within the flag for stripping `<script>` and `<style>` tags. An attacker can exploit this by injecting a malformed tag where the inner, unclosed substring causes the regex to match too much or too little, allowing the malicious JavaScript payload to remain in the output and execute in a victim's browser.",
