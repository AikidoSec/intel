  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a race condition in the Azure Cosmos DB .NET SDK when cross-region hedging is enabled. The issue arises in the `Trace` class, specifically in the `AddOrUpdateDatum` method, where multiple parallel threads attempt to update the same dictionary without proper synchronization. This lack of thread safety can lead to excessive CPU usage or `InvalidOperationException` errors during execution.",
