  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to `CVE-2025-27144` in `go-jose` v2, which can be exploited using malicious JWTs crafted with excessive dot separators or oversized payloads that trigger uncontrolled memory allocation during parsing. This patch adds defense-in-depth protections by rejecting tokens with more than five dots, enforcing a 1MB size limit, and updating dependencies. Because `go-jose` v2 is archived and will not be patched, full remediation will only be completed in v3 when the library migrates to `lestrrat-go/jwx`.",
