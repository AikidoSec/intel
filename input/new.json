  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package have a vulnerability that can lead to a runtime panic due to unsafe concurrent access to the `SupportedProtocols` map in the Ziti Go SDK. When multiple goroutines call `getEdgeRouterConn()` simultaneously, it may cause a fatal runtime error. An attacker could exploit this by sending numerous concurrent requests, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the application.",
