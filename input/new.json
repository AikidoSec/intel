  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to incorrect execution-assigned permissions when creating Aspects with the default execution order. An attacker can manipulate a roleâ€™s permission boundaries by assigning `DEFAULT` permissions to a custom Aspect, which may be overridden by a built-in CDK method using `MUTATING` permissions. This can result in custom Aspects having fewer permissions than intended. In environments with overly permissive policies, however, this misconfiguration could inadvertently grant higher-than-expected permissions.",
