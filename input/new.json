  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via JSON-RPC Request ID Reflection due to missing validation on string-based request IDs in the underlying `json_rpc_handler` dependency; this vulnerability occurs because user-supplied input within the `id` field is directly reflected in HTTP responses, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests containing HTML or JavaScript payloads in the ID, which are then executed in a victim's browser if the response is rendered without proper output encoding or Content-Type hardening.",
