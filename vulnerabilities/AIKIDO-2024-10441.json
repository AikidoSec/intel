  "tldr" : "Affected versions of this package may leak the unseal key in the logs. The unseal key is inadvertently logged when the `/sys/unseal` endpoint is accessed. This presents a significant security risk, as the key could end up in system logs, potentially written to disk due to swap mechanisms. Additionally, users may unknowingly transmit their unseal key to remote log servers if logging is misconfigured, further compromising security. It is essential to ensure that sensitive information like the unseal key is excluded from logs and to review log configuration to prevent accidental exposure.",
