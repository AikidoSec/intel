  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to command injection via malicious model artifacts. In the affected code, dependency specifications from a model’s `python_env.yaml` file were directly interpolated into a shell command when installing model dependencies. An attacker who can supply a crafted model artifact could include shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, backticks) in dependency strings, leading to arbitrary command execution during model deployment with `env_manager=LOCAL`. This PR fixes the issue by replacing vulnerable shell invocation with safe subprocess calls using structured argument lists parsed with `shlex.split()`, preventing injection of unintended commands.",
