  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable due to a flaw in inferno-server's server-side rendering pipeline where the `style` prop bypasses HTML entity escaping during `renderToString()` or `renderToStringStream()`, allowing an attacker who controls an untrusted style value (e.g., from a CMS, theme, or user API) to inject raw attributes like `onmouseover` by breaking out of the `style` context, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
