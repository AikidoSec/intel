  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a null pointer dereference when processing malformed ONNX models containing an empty `clip_min` tensor, causing the initializer to construct an empty tensor with an invalid data pointer that is dereferenced without validation, resulting in a crash and potential Denial of Service. An attacker could exploit this by supplying a specially crafted ONNX model with a zero-element `clip_min` input, triggering the failure during graph optimization and forcing the runtime session to terminate. The issue arises from missing size validation before accessing tensor data, allowing invalid inputs to disrupt execution. The mitigation introduces a size check to skip optimization when the tensor is empty, preventing the crash and improving robustness against malformed models.",
