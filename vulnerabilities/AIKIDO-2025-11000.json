  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package contain a server exposure vulnerability due to the default `HOST` configuration being set to `0.0.0.0`, which binds the service to all network interfaces; in SSE or HTTP mode, this allows any attacker on the same local network to connect to the exposed MCP server and leverage the embedded `GITLAB_TOKEN` permissions, leading to unauthorized access and potential misuse of GitLab credentials from other devices on the internal corporate network.",
