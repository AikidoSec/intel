  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via Unsafe YAML Deserialization because they use the `yaml.load()` API to process untrusted YAML input. An attacker can exploit this by providing a maliciously crafted YAML file that contains embedded Python commands, which are then automatically executed during the deserialization process, potentially leading to a complete system compromise.",
