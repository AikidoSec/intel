  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to improper input validation in the handling of malformed `Content-Disposition` filenames. When an invalid or unquoted filename is supplied, the server responds with an internal error (HTTP 500) instead of a client error (HTTP 400). This behavior can inadvertently leak internal details or implementation-specific error messages to an attacker, increasing the risk of information disclosure. The patch fixes this by validating the header properly and returning a 400 Bad Request instead of a 500.",
