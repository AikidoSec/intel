  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package may expose sensitive data because QR codes could be generated without a valid hash. This allowed attackers to iterate over order IDs, reveal payment amounts, and access increment IDs. The fix introduces a required hash derived from unique order attributes, ensuring that QR codes cannot be created—or guessed—without proper authorization.",
