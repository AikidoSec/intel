  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to command injection. In `cmake/cmake_extension.py`, build commands are constructed using user-controlled arguments and executed via `os.system()`, allowing shell metacharacters to be interpreted. This can allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands during the build process. The issue is fixed by switching to `subprocess.run()` with argument lists and `shell=False`, preventing command injection.",
