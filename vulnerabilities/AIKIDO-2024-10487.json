  "tldr" : "A bug introduced in `rustls` version 0.23.13 causes a panic when the server receives a fragmented TLS `ClientHello` message. This issue specifically affects servers that use the `rustls::server::Acceptor::accept()` function to handle incoming connections. A fragmented `ClientHello` can trigger the panic due to improper handling of message boundaries, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) if an attacker deliberately sends such messages.",
