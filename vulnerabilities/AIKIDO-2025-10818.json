  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper neutralization of user input in the `redirectTo` pathway. An attacker can exploit this by tricking a user into clicking a maliciously crafted link containing a script payload as the `location` parameter, which fails the redirect URL validation check and is then unsafely logged into the HTML response by the `defaultHandler`, causing the injected script to execute in the victim's browser when the error page is rendered.",
