  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package allow unintended directory disclosure when `StaticWithConfig` is used with `Browse: true` and no index file exists: directory listings are generated from the filesystem root instead of being constrained to `StaticConfig.Root`. An attacker can exploit this by requesting a browsable path (e.g., `/`) to enumerate files and directories outside the intended public directory, potentially discovering sensitive filenames, structure, and metadata such as sizes.",
