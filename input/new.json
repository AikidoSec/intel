  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) because `allowAbsoluteUrls` is not set to `false` by default when processing URLs in `buildFullPath()`. This unsafe default may lead to unintended URL acceptance, allowing attackers to bypass expected restrictions. As a result, URLs that should be blocked may be processed instead. This vulnerability effectively bypasses the fix for CVE-2025-27152.",
