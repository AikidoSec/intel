  "tldr" : "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to improper isolation and compartmentalization of permissions. In Grafana, incorrect permissions are applied to the alert rule write API endpoint, allowing users who have permission to write external alert instances to also modify alert rules. This flaw compromises the principle of least privilege by granting users unintended access, potentially leading to unauthorized changes in alert configurations and impacting the reliability and security of the monitoring system.",
