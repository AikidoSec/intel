  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution because the `skipKeys` validation in the object assignment loop did not block the specially crafted properties `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`. An attacker could exploit this by providing a malicious `source` object containing these properties, allowing them to pollute the global object prototype and potentially modify the application's behavior, crash the program, or achieve remote code execution.",
