  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip) due to improper validation of the `entry.path` within a zip archive before using it to construct the final extraction path. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious archive that contains a file with a relative path sequence (e.g., `../../tmp/evil.exe`), which, when extracted, would traverse outside the intended `outputPath` directory and overwrite arbitrary files on the system, potentially leading to remote code execution.",
