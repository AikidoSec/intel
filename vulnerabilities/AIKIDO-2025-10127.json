  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks due to improper validation of the `state` URL parameter. Without proper validation, attackers could exploit this flaw for CSRF or impersonation attacks. Similar issues have previously enabled phishing attempts by manipulating error messages. In recent updates, `remix-auth-oauth2` moved state management from session storage to cookies, requiring earlier validation in the handler. This patch ensures that only legitimate OAuth2 requests proceed while unauthorized attempts trigger a generic error page.",
