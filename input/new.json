  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds memory access during array indexing operations. When certain multi-dimensional indexing patterns are used, the parser could read past the end of internal stride/index tables, potentially causing undefined behavior, crashes, or denial-of-service conditions. The issue is fixed by adding proper boundary checks before accessing internal index data, ensuring that invalid dimension indexes do not lead to unsafe memory reads.",
