  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to improper input validation, allowing bypass of domain whitelisting in the `browser_use` module. Although the `allowed_domains` list is meant to restrict accessible URLs, an attacker can craft URLs with embedded basic authentication credentials—such as `https://example.com:pass@localhost:8080`—to trick the system into allowing navigation to unauthorized domains. This bypass arises from flawed parsing logic in the `_is_url_allowed()` method, which strips port and user information without verifying the true target domain. As a result, attackers may gain unauthorized access to internal services or perform enumeration on localhost and private networks.",
