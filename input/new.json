  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package rely on IdentityServer4, which is known to be vulnerable to open redirect attacks. Methods such as `GetAuthorizationContextAsync` and `IsValidReturnUrl` may return non-null or true for malicious URLs, enabling redirection to untrusted sites. Less commonly used methods, including `ServerUrlExtensions.GetIdentityServerRelativeUrl`, `ReturnUrlParser.ParseAsync`, and `OidcReturnUrlParser.ParseAsync`, are also affected by similar flaws. The issue is addressed in the fixed version by uninstalling IdentityServer4 packages and disabling related functionality.",
