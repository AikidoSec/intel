  "tldr" : "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to a race condition caused by concurrent execution using a shared resource with improper synchronization. The issue arises when setting a proxy to the client instance quickly after implementing the ability to define CONNECT headers. When a new proxy is set, the `connectDialer` writes proxy authentication credentials to the `DefaultHeader` map. This causes issues because, unlike previous versions that spawned a new header map each time, the same `connectHeaders` map is used in the latest update. Since concurrent map writes are not supported in Go, rapid proxy changes can eventually cause a panic due to multiple threads attempting to write to the same map simultaneously.",
