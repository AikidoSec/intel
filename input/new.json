  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) due to insufficient validation of the `x-custom-host` header, allowing attackers to redirect requests to arbitrary or internal network hosts. The fix introduces strict host and scheme validation, blocks private IP ranges and unsafe domains, and enforces a trusted host whitelist to prevent unauthorized network access.",
