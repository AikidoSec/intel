  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an authorization bypass due to Spring Security Aspects failing to correctly detect method-level security annotations on private methods. This issue occurs when `@EnableMethodSecurity(mode = ASPECTJ)` is used in combination with the `spring-security-aspects` module, and security annotations are applied to private methods. As a result, these methods may be invoked without the intended authorization checks, potentially allowing unauthorized access.",

You are not affected if you are not using `@EnableMethodSecurity(mode = ASPECTJ)` or the `spring-security-aspects` module, or if your application does not include any private methods annotated with Spring Security annotations.",
