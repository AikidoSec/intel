  "tldr": "Affected versions of the `azure-c-shared-utility` package are vulnerable to integer wraparound, under-allocation, or heap buffer overflow due to insufficient parameter validation. These flaws in buffer length handling can be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE) under specific conditions. Successful exploitation requires a compromised Azure account capable of sending malformed payloads via the IoT Hub service, bypassing the 128KB payload limit, and the ability to overwrite executable memory on the target device.",
