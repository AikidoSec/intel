  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package allow TFSMLayer to load external TensorFlow SavedModels during deserialization without honoring `safe_mode`, enabling attacker-controlled graphs to be registered and later executed during normal inference. An attacker could exploit this by supplying a malicious SavedModel (e.g., via a crafted config or model artifact) that bypasses `safe_mode=True`, causing unintended graph execution when the model is invoked, effectively violating Keras' safe deserialization guarantees and enabling execution of untrusted computation without explicit user opt-in.",
