  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package allow improper enforcement of file system permissions in the Node.js permission model, where `futimes()` can be used to modify file access and modification timestamps even when the process has only read permissions. Unlike `utimes()`, `futimes()` does not apply the expected write-permission checks, enabling metadata changes in read-only directories and potentially allowing attackers to obscure activity and undermine the reliability of logs.",
