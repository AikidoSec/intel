  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to memory leaks. When creating a subscription in `ObjectStore.get`, two long-running tasks—`_hbtask` for idle heartbeat and `_fctask` for ordered consumers—are created. These tasks are not cancelled when `sub.unsubscribe()` is called, causing them to continue running and holding references to the subscription and other objects. This prevents garbage collection, leading to a growing number of active coroutines (up to 20K observed) and resulting in increased memory usage and potential performance degradation.",
