  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a chain of security flaws including cross-tenant static asset access, a path traversal bypass, insecure cross-domain data endpoints, server-side rendering code execution, a site downgrade attack, and an IDOR in the dashboard. An attacker could exploit these in concert, for instance by uploading a malicious SVG via one vulnerability to execute cross-site scripting (XSS) on another customer's domain, potentially compromising user sessions and data. All issues have been fixed; the maintainer has added a deprecation notice on npm installs for vulnerable versions, and users must upgrade immediately.",
