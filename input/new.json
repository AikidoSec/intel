  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Race Condition in `oneshot::Receiver` Leading to Use-After-Free, where a race condition occurs if a `oneshot::Receiver` is polled but then dropped before completion, such as when canceled via a timeout future: upon polling, the Receiver writes a waker to the channel and sets it to `RECEIVING` state, but upon dropping, it swaps the state to `DISCONNECTED` and reads the waker from heap memory; if the Sender observes the `DISCONNECTED` state and deallocates the channel first, the Receiver reads from freed memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by precisely timing future cancellations to trigger the use-after-free condition, potentially leading to memory corruption, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.",
