  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to improper annotation resolution in the Spring Framework’s method hierarchy handling. When a parameterized supertype with unbounded generics is involved, annotations may not be correctly detected, which can bypass authorization checks when using Spring Security’s `@EnableMethodSecurity`.",
  "doest_this_affect_me": "You are affected if your application uses a vulnerable version in combination with `@EnableMethodSecurity` and applies security annotations on methods defined in generic superclasses or generic interfaces. Applications that do not use `@EnableMethodSecurity` or do not rely on such annotations are not impacted.",
