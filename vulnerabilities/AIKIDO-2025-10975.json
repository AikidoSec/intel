  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficient Input Validation due to inadequate error handling and bounds checking in serialization/deserialization logic. The vulnerability in Rust components could allow invalid integer conversions to proceed, while in C++ components, missing buffer length validation could permit reading beyond allocated memory. An attacker could exploit this by crafting malicious input data to trigger integer overflows/underflows in Rust or cause buffer over-reads and potential denial-of-service or information disclosure in C++.",
