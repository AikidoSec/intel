  "tldr": "Affected versions are vulnerable to arbitrary code execution through improper restrictions on the use of dunder (double underscore) methods in the `local_python_executor`. Malicious users could exploit access to unsafe dunder methods (e.g., `__subclasses__`, `__getattribute__`) to bypass sandbox restrictions, perform introspection, or execute unauthorized code. The patch mitigates this by explicitly blocking the use of non-whitelisted dunder methods.",
