The repository has been archived since August 2025, and users are encouraged to depend directly on the underlying PEM parsing code included in rustls-pki-types since 1.9.0. The latest version of rustls-pemfile is in fact a thin wrapper around the same code used in rustls-pki-types, so migrating should be straightforward.",
