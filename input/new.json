  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and untrusted content inclusion because the `HttpUriPlugin` did not properly revalidate HTTP redirect targets against the configured `allowedUris` policy, allowed non-http/https protocols (like `file:`), and lacked a redirect limit. An attacker could exploit this by hosting a malicious server that responds with a redirect to an internal service or local file, potentially bypassing URI restrictions and causing the application to fetch and cache sensitive data or execute unintended code from a dangerous location.",
