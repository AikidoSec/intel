  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) in the `openURLMiddleware`, where URLs supplied to the `/open-url` endpoint were passed directly to the system without proper sanitization. Specially crafted URLs containing shell metacharacters could trigger command injection, particularly on Windows systems. The patched version introduces strict URL validation and rejects malformed or malicious input, preventing unintended command execution.",
