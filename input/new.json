  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS): a flaw in the `data-loading-text` attribute of the Bootstrap button plugin (versions ≥ 1.4.0 to ≤ 3.4.1) allows malicious JavaScript to be injected and executed, for example when the button enters its loading state.",

  "how_to_fix": "To fix this vulnerability, upgrade to a later, supported version of Bootstrap, as version 3 is end-of-life and no longer receives security updates. Alternatively, use a paying maintained (like HeroDevs')`bootstrap@3.4.5`, which includes a patch that properly sanitizes data attributes and prevents XSS attacks.",
