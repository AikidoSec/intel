  "tldr": "In this case, the `fast-float2::common::AsciiStr::first` method within the `AsciiStr` struct uses the unsafe keyword to reading from memory without performing bounds checking. Specifically, it directly dereferences a pointer offset by `self.ptr`. Because of the above reason, the method accesses invalid memory address when it takes an empty string as its input. This approach violates Rustâ€™s memory safety guarantees, as it can lead to invalid memory access if empty buffer is provided.",
