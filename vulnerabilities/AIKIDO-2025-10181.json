  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption. A security issue in Kubernetes (as described in CVE-2025-0426) allows an attacker to exploit the unauthenticated kubelet read-only HTTP endpoint by making a large number of container checkpoint requests, which can fill the Node's disk and cause a Denial of Service. To address this vulnerability, the `sigs.k8s.io/azuredisk-csi-driver` package required multiple significant changes to adapt to the Kubernetes upgrade.",
