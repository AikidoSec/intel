  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package may cache sensitive data. Session-related responses, including those with the `__session` cookie, may be cached by browsers or CDNs if proper cache-control headers are missing. This can expose authentication tokens or personal data to unintended parties. The patch enforces strict cache control by validating the `Set-Cookie` header and adding `Cache-Control: private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, max-age=0` to prevent caching of sensitive responses.",
