  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to prototype pollution due to improper validation of nested message keys in the `addMessages` method. When processing message data, the package fails to sanitize special object keys such as `__proto__`, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary properties into `Object.prototype`. This can lead to denial of service (DoS) or unpredictable application behavior.",
