  "tldr" : "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks due to inadequate recursion limit enforcement. A regression introduced after a fix in version 3.14.1 allows crafted input to trigger excessive recursive calls, potentially leading to stack exhaustion. This flaw can be exploited by attackers to crash the application or render it unresponsive, disrupting service availability. It is recommended to update to a patched version to mitigate this issue.",
