  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) due to unbounded parameter parsing in `Rack::QueryParser`, which can result in memory exhaustion. In the patched version, support was added for limiting the parameter using the environment variables `RACK_QUERY_PARSER_PARAMS_LIMIT` and `RACK_QUERY_PARSER_BYTESIZE_LIMIT` (default limits of 4096 parameters and 4MB total byte size), as well as through `QueryParser` constructor options. If either limit is exceeded, a `Rack::QueryParser::QueryLimitError` is raised, with `ParamsTooDeepError` now aliased for compatibility with existing error handling.",
