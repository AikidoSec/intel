  "tldr": "Akka versions <=2.4.16 and 2.5-M1 are vulnerable to a Java deserialization attack in the `Remoting` component. This vulnerability allows an attacker to send specially crafted serialized objects to the `ActorSystem`, which can trigger deserialization and execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Exploiting this flaw results in Remote Code Execution (RCE).",
