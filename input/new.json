  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to local file inclusion (LFI) due to insufficient path validation in the `ExternalNotebookData` gRPC endpoint. The `get_notebook_data` function only checks if the file path ends with `.ipynb`, allowing attackers to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access arbitrary files. Although the server binds to `localhost` by default, custom or cloud deployments exposed to external networks may be at risk of unauthorized file access.",
