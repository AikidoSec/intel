  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to a denial-of-service condition due to a memory leak in Node.js’s OpenSSL integration. When converting X.509 certificate fields to UTF-8, allocated buffers are not freed, causing each call to `socket.getPeerCertificate(true)` to leak memory. A remote client can exploit this by repeatedly establishing TLS connections, leading to unbounded memory growth and eventual resource exhaustion.",
