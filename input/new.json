  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to remote code execution due to unsafe deserialization in the `pickle_operations` function within `monai/data/utils.py`. This function automatically deserializes dictionary values with specific suffixes using `pickle.loads()` without any security measures. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious dataset with keys like `preprocessing_transforms` containing a pickled payload. When processed using MONAI's `list_data_collate` function, it can execute malicious code during data loading, potentially allowing the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the system.",
