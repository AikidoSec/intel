  "tldr": "Affected versions are vulnerable to improper input validation because `EndpointRequest.to()` can create a matcher for `null/**` when the referenced actuator endpoint is disabled or not exposed. Applications are not affected if they don't use Spring Security, don't use `EndpointRequest.to()`, the referenced endpoint is enabled and exposed, or if they don't handle requests to `/null` or the path doesn't need protection.",
  "doest_this_affect_me": "You are affected if you are using a version that falls within the vulnerable range anf if your applications use Spring Security, configure security chains with `EndpointRequest.to()`, the referenced endpoint is disabled or not exposed via web, and the application handles requests to `/null` that require protection.",
  "how_to_fix": "Upgrade the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-actuator-autoconfigure` library to the patch version. Or make sure that the endpoint to which `EndpointRequest.to()` is referring to is enabled and exposed via web or make sure that you don't handle requests to `/null`",
