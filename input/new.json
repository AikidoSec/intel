  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to prototype pollution through the `replacePlaceholders` function. An attacker can manipulate object properties via crafted input, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security bypasses. The patch addresses this by implementing robust input sanitization and safe property assignment to prevent unauthorized modification of object prototypes, while also strengthening protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) through improved data handling.",
