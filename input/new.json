  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to authentication bypass in the inbox handler, allowing unauthenticated attackers to impersonate any ActivityPub actor. The vulnerability arises because activity messages are processed before verifying that the HTTP Signature key belongs to the claimed actor. This flaw enables actor impersonation. The patched version mitigates the issue by performing authentication checks before processing activities.",
