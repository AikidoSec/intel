  "tldr": "In version `5.0.0`, the package changes its configuration system for backup storage, dropping support for `DBBACKUP_STORAGE` and `DBBACKUP_STORAGE_OPTIONS` in favor of Django’s `STORAGES['dbbackup']` setting. However, if users do not explicitly define `STORAGES['dbbackup']`, the system defaults to using Django’s media directory (`MEDIA_ROOT`) as the backup location. This default behavior introduces a serious security vulnerability, as it can expose database backups — potentially containing sensitive user data — in a publicly accessible directory. The issue highlights the risk of insecure default configurations, where failing to define a new setting silently leads to unsafe behavior instead of triggering an explicit error. The fixed version will raise an error if the `STORAGES['dbbackup']` setting is not defined, preventing the exposure of sensitive data.",
