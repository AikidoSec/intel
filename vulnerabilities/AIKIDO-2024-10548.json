  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an integer overflow due to improper handling of large integers. Specifically, the use of `strconv.Itoa` leads to an int64 to int conversion overflow on 32-bit platforms. The issue has been addressed in the patched version by replacing `strconv.Itoa` with `strconv.FormatInt`, ensuring safe handling of large integers.",
