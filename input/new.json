  "tldr": "The `surf` crate is no longer maintained, as indicated by the developer. Its last release dates back to 2021—over three years ago—making it outdated. It relies on the deprecated `async-std` runtime and an obsolete version of `rustls` for TLS support, both of which introduce risks related to security, performance, and compatibility with modern Rust tooling. Use of this crate is discouraged in favor of actively maintained alternatives.",
