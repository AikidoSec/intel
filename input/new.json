  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe deserialization of user-controlled input when using plugins. Specifically, the `model_revision` parameter can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary Python code, posing a significant security risk in environments where untrusted input reaches the `pipeline` function. The issue is addressed in the patched version by introducing the `trust_remote_code` parameter in the `from_pretrained` function, which controls whether remote code execution is allowed. By default, this parameter is set to `False`, preventing unauthorized or untrusted code from being executed.",
