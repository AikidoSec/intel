  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an Out-of-Bounds (OOB) read due to improper handling of Buffer objects in the `HTTP/2` client implementation. When the encoding is set to `buffer`, the code uses `chunk.buffer` without accounting for the byte offset and length of the original `TypedArray/Buffer` view, causing the entire underlying `ArrayBuffer` to be transmitted. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a Buffer slice from a larger memory region containing sensitive data, where the transmission of the entire underlying `ArrayBuffer` via `op_http2_client_send_data()` exposes adjacent memory contents beyond the intended chunk boundaries, leading to information disclosure or crashes.",
