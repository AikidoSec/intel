  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to undefined behavior due to improper handling of an error variable. The variable is shared across multiple requests, as it uses the same memory address as an error defined outside the function. This results in memory overwrites, leading to crashes and other unpredictable behavior.",
