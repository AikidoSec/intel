  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to sensitive information exposure in logs due to incomplete redaction in the `redactByField()` function. Objects passed via the `{*}` wildcard retained their original references, causing sensitive fields to appear in log messages even when properties were marked for redaction. The issue is fixed by ensuring `redactByField()` properly redacts sensitive values both in the wildcard-passed objects and within the message array itself.",
