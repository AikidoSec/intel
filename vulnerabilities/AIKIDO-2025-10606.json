  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) via a deeply nested GraphQL query. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting and sending a malicious query with excessive nesting levels, which would consume disproportionate amounts of CPU and memory resources during parsing and execution. It could lead to service degradation or a complete outage, as the existing timeout mechanism might not trigger quickly enough to prevent resource exhaustion.",
