  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package allow newline-separated command injection where only the first line is validated. An attacker can place a multi-line instruction containing a benign read-only command followed by a malicious one, bypassing safety checks because the parser did not treat `\n`/`\r\n` as command separators. As a result, validation approves the first command while subsequent arbitrary commands execute silently without user confirmation.",
