  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to path traversal and command injection. The export handler accepts a user-controlled file path without properly validating that it stays within the workspace directory, which allows attackers to write files to arbitrary locations. In addition, shell commands are constructed using unsanitized file paths, enabling command injection via shell metacharacters. These issues can allow arbitrary file writes and execution of unintended commands.",
