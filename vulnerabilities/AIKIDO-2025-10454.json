  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) via absolute path manipulation in gltf-pipeline, a library used for optimizing and converting glTF/glB 3D models. While the library restricts remote HTTP(s) URI fetching, it fails to validate absolute paths, allowing attackers to embed arbitrary local files into the generated glB output when processing maliciously crafted models. An attacker could exploit this by providing a buffer resource as a file URL, leading to unauthorized file disclosure if the library is used in server-side workflows. This could expose sensitive system files or application data depending on the server's permissions.",
