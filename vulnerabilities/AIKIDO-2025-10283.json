  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTML clobbering, where malicious HTML elements can interfere with the initialization of connect.js. If the host page's `<head>` contains nested `<a>` tags with `id= StripeConnect` and `name= init`, it may falsely assume connect.js is initialized. An attacker can inject HTML like `<a id='StripeConnect'><a id='StripeConnect' name='init' href='stripe'></a></a>`, leading to improper script execution, security bypasses, or other unintended behaviors.",
