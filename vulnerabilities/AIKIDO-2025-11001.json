  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an integer underflow in the `FileStream::try_range_response` function when handling empty files, which may lead to denial of service (DoS); this vulnerability occurs due to improper calculation of range responses for zero-size files, causing an integer underflow that can result in memory corruption or application crash. An attacker can exploit this by sending a malicious range request targeting an empty file, triggering the underflow, and potentially crashing the service, thereby causing a DoS condition.",
