  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Uninitialized Memory Access in `RawInline::clone()`, where the clone function incorrectly assumed data was stored contiguously, so after deletions, control bytes pointed to uninitialized memory. An attacker could exploit this by manipulating map deletions to induce cloning, potentially reading uninitialized memory to disclose sensitive information or cause memory corruption.",
