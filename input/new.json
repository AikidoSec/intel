  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package allow creating or updating a user password through the User Public API without preventing the password from matching the username. This behavior weakens basic account-security expectations, since a password identical to the username is trivial to guess and significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. Proper validation should enforce a minimum level of password uniqueness and reject credentials that reuse the username.",
