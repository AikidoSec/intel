  "tldr": "Affected versions of the `tendermint-rs` package are vulnerable to a critical flaw in the light client implementation due to improper validation of validator identities. Specifically, the client fails to ensure that a validatorâ€™s address is correctly derived from its public key when counting votes. This allows an attacker to spoof validator signatures and forge a malicious block that appears to be signed by a 2/3+ majority, causing the light client to incorrectly trust and accept the block.",
