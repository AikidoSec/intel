  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package contain a flaw where nested google.protobuf.Any messages can bypass the configured max_recursion_depth, allowing uncontrolled recursion. An attacker can exploit this by crafting deeply nested Any payloads that trigger recursive calls via _ConvertAnyMessage() and methodcaller(), bypassing depth tracking. It can exhaust the call stack during message parsing, resulting in a denial-of-service attack through stack overflow and process crash.",
