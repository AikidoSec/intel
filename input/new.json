  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package had insufficient access control on several user-related controller actions in `UsersController`, allowing certain user management operations (such as impersonation, sending activation or password reset emails, enabling/disabling accounts, etc.) to be invoked without enforcing the appropriate permission and context checks. The patched version centralizes and strengthens these checks (`userActionChecks`), requiring proper post requests, control-panel context, edition, and `editUsers` permission before performing sensitive user actions, preventing unauthorized access and privilege escalation.",
