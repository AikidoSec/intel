  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to denial-of-service conditions due to insufficient enforcement of array limits during query string decoding. Crafted inputs can cause arrays to grow beyond the configured `listLimit`, leading to excessive memory consumption. The updated decoding logic introduces explicit overflow tracking and converts oversized arrays into map-based representations when limits are exceeded, aligning behavior with Node.js `qs` semantics and preventing unbounded memory growth.",
