  "tldr": "Affected versions of Kamal are vulnerable to command injection attacks in its Passbolt adapter: an unsanitized folder ID (`item[\"id\"]`) was interpolated directly into a shell command. The patched version adds `.to_s.shellescape` to that value before constructing the command, ensuring that any special characters are properly escaped — preventing arbitrary OS command execution when handling untrusted input.",
