  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to improper output encoding or escaping. The issue stems from using `PATH_INFO` instead of `REQUEST_URI`. Since `PATH_INFO` includes URL-decoded values, encoded URLs may improperly match routes they should not, leading to security risks. This flaw allows characters like `%2f` to bypass routing restrictions, potentially exposing unintended resources. Switching to `REQUEST_URI` ensures proper handling of encoded URLs and mitigates this vulnerability.",
