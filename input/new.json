  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an integer overflow in the date calculation functions, where the old code performed unchecked multiplication, which could result in a panic on overflow. The patched code introduces a safe check to prevent this. An attacker could exploit this by supplying a huge `multiplier` value that causes an integer overflow, triggering a panic and resulting in a denial-of-service condition.",
