  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution due to improper input validation when parsing objects containing the `__proto__` property. Attackers could exploit this by submitting a crafted object with a `__proto__` key, allowing them to pollute the global object prototype. This could lead to modification of application behavior, privilege escalation, or denial of service by injecting malicious properties inherited by all objects.",
