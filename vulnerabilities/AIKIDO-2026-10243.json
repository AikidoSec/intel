  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read due to improper validation of Modbus write request parameters. When handling `WRITE_MULTIPLE_COILS` or `WRITE_MULTIPLE_REGISTERS` requests, the implementation validates the number of requested values but fails to verify that the supplied byte count contains sufficient data for those values. An attacker can send a crafted Modbus request with inconsistent length fields, causing the application to read beyond the bounds of the request buffer, resulting in a denial of service or potential information disclosure. The issue is fixed by validating that the provided byte count matches the declared number of values before processing the request.",
