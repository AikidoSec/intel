  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to improper email address parsing in the email sign-in flow. Due to a flaw in Nodemailerâ€™s address parser (fixed in Nodemailer v7.0.7), a crafted input such as `\"e@attacker.com\"@victim.com` is misinterpreted, causing authentication emails to be sent to `e@attacker.com` (attacker-controlled) instead of the intended recipient `<e@attacker.com>@victim.com`. This issue allows an attacker to intercept login or verification links, leading to potential account takeover or unauthorized access.",
