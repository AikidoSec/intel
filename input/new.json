  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a directory traversal or zip slip issue during ZIP extraction. When extracting multiple ZIP files, an attacker can bypass the `isOutsideTargetFolder` check by first extracting a ZIP file containing a symlink to an arbitrary directory (e.g., `/tmp/`) and then extracting another ZIP file with files or symlinks targeting that location. This allows files to be written outside the intended extraction directory, potentially leading to unauthorized file writes.",
