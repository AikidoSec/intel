  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to denial-of-service conditions due to improper TLS error handling when `pskCallback` or `ALPNCallback` are used. Synchronous exceptions thrown during these callbacks bypass standard TLS error handling paths (`tlsClientError` and `error`), resulting in either immediate process termination or silent file descriptor leaks that can exhaust resources over time. Because these callbacks process attacker-controlled input during the TLS handshake, a remote client can repeatedly trigger the issue.",
