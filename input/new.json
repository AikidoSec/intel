  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package contain a polynomial-time regular expression that processes uncontrolled input when parsing `<head>` and `<body>` tags, which may lead to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to catastrophic backtracking. The vulnerable pattern (`[^]*`) matches arbitrary characters until a closing `>` is found, allowing excessive processing time on crafted inputs. An attacker could exploit this by submitting specially crafted HTML strings with repeated `<head` or `<body` sequences and malformed attributes, causing high CPU consumption and degrading or blocking application availability.",
