  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package treated `awk` and `sed` commands as read-only even though they support side-effects like `system()` execution, file writes, and shell pipelines. This could allow crafted `awk` or `sed` input to execute arbitrary commands or perform file operations without user confirmation. The patched version adds comprehensive pattern-based detection for dangerous constructs in `awk` and `sed`, rejecting commands with side-effects and preventing unintended command execution.",
