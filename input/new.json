  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution due to improper handling of Blade templates. The vulnerability occurs because user-controlled template content is processed using the unsafe `eval()` function instead of the secure `Blade::render()` method. An attacker could exploit this by injecting malicious PHP code into a Blade template, which would then be executed with the application's privileges when the template is compiled. It could lead to complete compromise of the application server and underlying system.",
