  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to integer overflow in the `writeYAMLEnvironmentDiagnostics` function in `cmd/esc/cli/env.go`. The vulnerability arises from unsafe instantiation of `hcl.NewDiagnosticTextWriter` using potentially unbounded width values. The issue is addressed by first initializing the writer with a width of 0 and conditionally reinstantiating it only if the specified width is greater than 0, mitigating the risk flagged by gosec G115.",
