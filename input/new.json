  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a buffer overflow caused by improper validation of socket file descriptor values when using the `FD_SET` macro. When a TCP connection is accepted with a file descriptor greater than or equal to `FD_SETSIZE`, `FD_SET` writes past the bounds of the `fd_set` structure, resulting in memory corruption or application crashes. An attacker can trigger this condition by exhausting available file descriptors so that newly accepted connections receive high-numbered descriptors, leading to a denial of service or potential memory corruption. The issue is fixed by validating file descriptor values and rejecting descriptors exceeding `FD_SETSIZE` before invoking `FD_SET`.",
