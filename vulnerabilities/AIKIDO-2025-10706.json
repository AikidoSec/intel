  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Interpretation Conflict due to improper handling of quoted local-parts. The vulnerability occurs because the code attempts to extract email addresses from plain text but fails to properly account for RFC 5321 quoting rules, which allow the @ symbol within quoted local-parts (e.g., `'user@domain'@example.com`). An attacker can exploit this by crafting an email with a quoted local-part containing an @ symbol, which may cause the application to incorrectly extract a spoofed address (e.g., `attacker@example.com'@legitimate.com`) and misroute sensitive data to an attacker-controlled domain.",
