  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a null pointer dereference caused by improper handling of null values returned by the allocator in the `SharedPointer::alloc` process. An attacker can trigger an out-of-memory condition during shared pointer allocation, leading to dereferencing a null pointer through safe deserialization APIs and resulting in a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
