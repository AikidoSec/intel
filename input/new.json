  "tldr": "With TLS 1.3 pre-shared keys (PSK), a malicious or faulty server could ignore the client’s request for perfect forward secrecy (PFS) and still establish a PSK connection without PFS. This occurs when the server responds to a `ClientHello` containing `psk_dhe_ke` without including a `key_share` extension. As a result, the client may unknowingly reuse an authenticated PSK connection without PFS, reducing the overall security of the connection.",
