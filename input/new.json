  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to prototype pollution through the `config()` function. This occurs because the function fails to properly sanitize the content of its parameters, allowing an attacker to manipulate the prototype of built-in JavaScript objects. Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to unexpected application behavior, data corruption, or security issues, as malicious properties may be injected into objects globally.",
