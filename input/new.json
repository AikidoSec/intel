  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL injection. To mitigate unsafe SQL execution, additional restrictions were added to block dangerous statements. `MySQLSelectTool` now forbids the use of `INTO`, `OUTFILE`, `DUMPFILE`, and `LOAD_FILE`, preventing attackers from writing files or reading arbitrary server files. Similarly, `MySQLWriteTool` was updated to disallow high-risk statements such as `DROP`, `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `GRANT`, `TRUNCATE`, `REPLACE`, `MERGE`, `CALL`, `EXECUTE`, and `DELETE`, reducing the risk of destructive or privilege-escalating SQL operations when user-controlled input is present.",
