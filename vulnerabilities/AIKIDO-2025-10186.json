  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect due to insufficient validation of redirect paths in the login flow. An attacker can exploit this to redirect users to malicious websites. This issue is addressed by introducing the `getSafeRedirect` utility, which ensures redirect paths start with a single `/`, blocks protocol-relative URLs (e.g., `//evil.com`), prevents JavaScript scheme execution (e.g., `/javascript:alert(1)`), and blocks full URL redirects such as `/http:` or `/https:`.",
