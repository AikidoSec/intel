  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Multi-Factor Authentication Bypass via Improper Code Invalidation due to an adjusted user authentication flow that invalidates active MFA codes before login and verifies login status during validation. This flaw allows an attacker to invalidate a user's MFA codes prematurely, potentially bypassing MFA requirements or causing login failures. An attacker could exploit this by initiating login attempts that trigger MFA invalidation without completing authentication, leading to account lockout or unauthorized access if the system fails to properly validate the user's login state during MFA verification.",
