  "tldr": "Affected versions of Mbed TLS up to `2.8.9` and `3.x` up to `3.6.2` are vulnerable to a server impersonation issue due to an insecure default configuration. If a TLS client does not explicitly call `mbedtls_ssl_set_hostname()`, the hostname verification step is skipped, allowing any server with a valid certificate from a trusted CA to impersonate any other server. This flaw enables a network-based attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially accessing or modifying sensitive data exchanged over TLS.",
  "doest_this_affect_me": "You are affected if you are using a version that falls within the vulnerable range.",
  "how_to_fix": "To mitigate the vulnerability, TLS client applications should always call `mbedtls_ssl_set_hostname()` with the expected server name, unless only pre-shared key cipher suites are used. Upgrading to Mbed TLS `2.28.10` or `3.6.3` is strongly recommended, as these versions enforce hostname verification by default. Clients using certificate pinning or operating in a closed, trusted environment may not be affected, but calling `mbedtls_ssl_set_hostname()` is still advised as a defense-in-depth measure.",
