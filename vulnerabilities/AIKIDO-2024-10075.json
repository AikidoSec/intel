  "tldr" : "Affected versions of the `@tiptap/extension-youtube` library are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to a flaw in the `getEmbedUrlFromYoutubeUrl` function. An attacker can craft a response that stores a YouTube video with a URL containing `/embed/`, such as `javascript:alert(1)//embed/`, allowing arbitrary code execution in the site's origin. This vulnerability is considered low severity, as exploiting it would require the attacker to manipulate the TipTap payload in a way that bypasses the YouTube extension's `setYoutubeVideo` command, which already validates URLs.",
