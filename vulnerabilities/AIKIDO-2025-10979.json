  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsafe Preview Rendering due to improper neutralization of user input during web page generation. The vulnerability exists because user-supplied HTML, including attributes like `onerror`, is rendered without adequate sanitization when switching from code to preview mode. An attacker can exploit this by tricking a user into submitting a malicious payload, which executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser when the preview is rendered.",
