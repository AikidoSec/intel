Attackers could exploit this by injecting malicious trailers to bypass security controls, enabling session hijacking (via forced cookie adoption), redirect attacks (through injected Location headers), or IP spoofing (using `X-Forwarded-For` header) to mask their origin or trigger incorrect access decisions.",
