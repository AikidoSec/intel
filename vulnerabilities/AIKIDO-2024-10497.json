  "tldr" : "Affected versions of `@intlify/core-base` are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) when using locale message Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) in development mode or custom ASTs. The `createI18n` and `useI18n` functions allow passing locale messages, which are compiled into ASTs for performance optimization during production builds using plugins like `@intlify/unplugin-vue-i18n`. However, if these ASTs are not precompiled or are manipulated by a third party, there is a risk of XSS.",
