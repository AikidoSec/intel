  "tldr": "Affected versions of `wolfssl` are vulnerable to generating weak or predictable random values when applications call `RAND_bytes()` after `fork()` due to unexpected behavior in `RAND_poll()` within the OpenSSL compatibility layer. This issue can result in insufficiently reseeded randomness in child processes, potentially weakening security for applications that rely on `RAND_bytes()` post-fork, though internal TLS operations are not affected. Updating to a fixed version ensures the DRBG is properly reseeded after a fork.",
