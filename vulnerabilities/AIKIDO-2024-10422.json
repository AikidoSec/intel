  "tldr": "A race condition bug exists in the login flow that, in rare cases, could allow one user to assume the identity of another due to concurrent login attempts. This vulnerability arises when multiple users try to log in at the same time, leading to incorrect session handling and potential session fixation, allowing an attacker to hijack another user's session.",
