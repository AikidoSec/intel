  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a Path Equivalence vulnerability, where the route splitting function inadequately preserves empty segments during path processing, as evidenced by the old code that filters out empty segments using `filter(Boolean)`, allowing attackers to bypass access restrictions and rate limits by crafting requests with multiple slashes in the URL path that are incorrectly normalized and treated as identical routes.",
