  "tldr": "Electron before versions 11.0.0-beta.6, 10.1.2, 9.3.1 or 8.5.2 is vulnerable to a context isolation bypass. This is a context isolation bypass, meaning that code running in the main world context in the renderer can reach into the isolated Electron context and perform privileged actions.",
  "doest_this_affect_me": "You are affected if you are using a version that falls within the vulnerable range and if your app enables both `contextIsolation` and `sandbox: true`, or if it combines `contextIsolation` with `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames: true`..",
