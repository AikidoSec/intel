  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution, where the code insufficiently validates properties during merging by checking only own properties with _hasOwnProperty, allowing attackers to craft malicious YAML input that injects keys like `__proto__` or `constructor` into the object prototype. This vulnerability can lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or other security breaches when the polluted objects are handled in the application.",
