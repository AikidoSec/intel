  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to path traversal because user-supplied filenames are concatenated directly into filesystem paths. The fix introduces strict filename validation with a regex, resolves paths with `realpath()`, and ensures they remain within the allowed directory, preventing `../` traversal and unauthorized file access or deletion.",
