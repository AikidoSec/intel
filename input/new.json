  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package suffered from a code-injection vulnerability: attacker-controlled values provided as field names or encoding names could lead to arbitrary code execution within the parser. The patch introduces sanitization logic: it validates field names and encoding names against a safe pattern and rejects invalid ones — preventing injection via malformed names or encoding values.",
