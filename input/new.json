  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package contain an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in the `_object_to_tool_call` function due to unsafe use of `eval()`. The function attempts to convert string items in a list to dictionaries via `eval(item)` without sanitization, allowing attackers to craft malicious strings that execute arbitrary Python code when processed. For example, an attacker could submit a payload like `__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')` as a item, enabling remote command execution, data deletion, or system compromise if the input originates from untrusted sources.",
