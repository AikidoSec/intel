  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authorization Bypass due to an insecure default configuration where the `disable_security` flag was set to `True`, which disables key browser security features like Same-Origin Policy and Content Security Policy (CSP). An attacker could exploit this by tricking a user into visiting a malicious webpage, which could then execute arbitrary commands on the machine by abusing the exposed Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) connection, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the system.",
