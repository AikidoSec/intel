  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to a race condition. The `socket` module provides a pure-Python fallback to the `socket.socketpair()` function for platforms that do not support AF_UNIX, such as Windows. This implementation uses AF_INET or AF_INET6 to create a local connected pair of sockets. However, the connection between the two sockets is not verified before returning them to the user, leaving the server socket vulnerable to a connection race from a malicious local peer.",
