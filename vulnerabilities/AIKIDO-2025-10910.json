  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (xss): the module does not sufficiently sanitize the `infoLabel` value in certain configurations, allowing injected script content. The risk is reduced because only uncommon configurations expose the affected `infoLabel` output, and an attacker must have user-level access to provide or modify this value.",
