  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are affected by a race condition in a method that implements non-contiguous locks on shared data. This situation allows other goroutines to modify `h.sources` or `h.previousEvents` between lock and unlock cycles, which can lead to data corruption and system outages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.",
