  "tldr": "Affected versions of this callback do not support validating a CSRF token by default for the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow. By requiring this as part of the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow, authorization flows are by default secured against cross-site request forgery. This is a breaking change, as it requires the user to pass a CSRF token.",
