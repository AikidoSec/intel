  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) because `decode_definite_long_string()` can drive a decoder into an unlimited read loop. The function retains an outdated `buffer_size` after consuming UTF-8 leftovers; on the next iteration it computes `chunk_length = 65536 - buffer_size`, which can become negative and is then passed unchecked to `read(-1)`. This results in an unbounded read followed by a `CBORDecodeEOF` error, allowing an attacker who can feed a crafted stream to cause excessive resource consumption or crash the decoder.",
