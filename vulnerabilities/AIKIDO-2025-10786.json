  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The snappy decoder failed to respect request size limits enforced by VictoriaMetrics components, allowing malformed snappy blocks to trigger excessive memory allocations. This could result in out-of-memory (OOM) errors and service instability. The fix enforces block size validation in ingest endpoints based on the configured `MaxRequest` limits.",
