  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package construct system commands by concatenating `cmd` and user-controlled options into a single string, which may allow command injection when executed through a shell. Because arguments are not safely passed as separate parameters (e.g., via `Open3.capture3` with explicit `cmd` and `args`), malicious input can manipulate command structure. An attacker could supply crafted option values containing shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `&&`, backticks) to execute arbitrary commands on the host system.",
