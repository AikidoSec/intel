  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package fail to properly sanitize user-supplied data when used inside a function that creates a `page_title` attribute for the specified input, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this by injecting malicious JavaScript or HTML into the title creation input field. This unsafe front-end rendering allows the execution of scripts in a victim's browser, potentially stealing session cookies or handling other client-side exploits.",
