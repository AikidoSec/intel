  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) via unsanitized SVG data URIs, because `data:image/svg+xml` sources could contain embedded JavaScript (such as `<script>` tags, event handlers, or `javascript:` hrefs) that bypass normal upload validation. The patched version adds runtime sanitization of SVG data URIs using the TYPO3 core `SvgSanitizer`, ensuring that malicious content is removed before rendering. This mitigation prevents XSS attacks via inline SVG payloads in image sources.",
