  "how_to_fix": "Upgrade the `Radzen.Blazor` library to the patch version. Note: some breaking changes have been introduced (compared to 6.3.x). Unicode symbols for icons must now be used directly as characters rather than HTML entities (e.g., replace `<RadzenIcon Icon=\"&#xf015\"/>` with `<RadzenIcon Icon=\"@(\"\")\"/>`). Additionally, dialog titles no longer support HTML content—developers should use `DialogContent` instead.",
