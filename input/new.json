  "tldr": "In Mbed TLS 3.6.0, the functions `mbedtls_ecdsa_der_to_raw()` and `mbedtls_ecdsa_raw_to_der()` are vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow if the `bits` argument exceeds the maximum curve size, due to missing validation. When `MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C` is disabled, these functions may use a zero-sized internal buffer, leading to overflows even with valid input. This affects applications that invoke these functions on attacker-controlled input, allowing an attacker to trigger a buffer overflow by manipulating the declared curve bit size.",
