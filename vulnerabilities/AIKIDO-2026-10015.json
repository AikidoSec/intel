  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attacks due to a non-constant time string comparison in the `==` method for password hash verification (the original code used super, which is typically a regular equality check). An attacker could exploit this by analyzing the time taken to compare a guessed secret against the stored hash to infer information about the hash and potentially brute-force the password more efficiently. The patched code implements a constant-time comparison by iterating through each byte and using a bitwise OR operation, ensuring the comparison time does not depend on the input.",
