  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to account impersonation due to insufficient validation of the `?account=` query parameter in the management server’s authentication middleware. An authenticated user could provide an arbitrary account ID when accessing the `/api/peers/<peer_id>/accessible-peers` endpoint and potentially access accounts they are not authorized to control. The issue is fixed by adding explicit validation with `IsValidChildAccount()`, ensuring account switching is only allowed for legitimate child accounts.",
