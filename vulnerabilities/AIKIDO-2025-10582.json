  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a CORS bypass that can expose sensitive files through the `/files` endpoint even when proper origin restrictions (`allow_origin_pat`) are configured. The issue arises because the XSRF validation logic does not check the request's origin before serving files. As a result, an attacker can exploit a shared-domain XSRF cookie and craft cross-origin requests to bypass CORS protections and access restricted files. The fix adds an explicit origin check in the `check_xsrf_cookie` flow to ensure that only allowed origins can access `/files`.",
