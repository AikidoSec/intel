  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are affected by a flaw in the group's module that allows a malicious proposal to trigger a division by zero, causing a chain halt. The issue arises from improper input validation and unprotected mathematical operations in proposal processing. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a proposal that results in a zero divisor, disrupting the entire chain and leading to denial of service (DoS).",
