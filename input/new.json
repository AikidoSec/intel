  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an open redirect, addressed via a backported security fix (CVE-2025-50181) from `urllib3` v2.5.0. The `urllib3-future` package is designed for use in Pyodide environments, enabling Python HTTP requests through the JavaScript Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest. Although it offers redirect control via `retries` and `redirect` parameters, these are ineffective in Pyodide, where the runtime governs redirect behaviorâ€”potentially allowing malicious redirects if not properly handled.",
