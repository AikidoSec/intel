  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to client-side attacks due to inadequate sanitization of the `href` attribute in the `Link` component. The code fails to validate or sanitize URLs, allowing dangerous schemes (e.g., `javascript:`, `data:`) in the `href` prop. By supplying a malicious `href` (e.g., through user-controlled inputs), an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript when a victim clicks the link, compromising user sessions, stealing sensitive data, or performing unauthorized actions within the application.",
