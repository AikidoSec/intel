  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in Application Logs due to improper handling of security context during error logging. When role-switching operations fail, the system erroneously writes full HTTP authentication context details, including access tokens and base paths, into log files in plain text. Attackers with access to these logs can harvest information to impersonate legitimate users, escalate privileges, bypass authentication controls, or directly access protected resources without authorization.",
