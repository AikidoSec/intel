  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to improper sanitization of user-controlled input in the OAuth callback handler. The vulnerability occurs when the application constructs a redirect URL by directly embedding unescaped query parameters into JavaScript and HTML content. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious URL with harmful JavaScript in the query parameters, which executes in the victim's browser when they complete the OAuth flow, potentially leading to session hijacking or unauthorized actions.",
