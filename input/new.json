  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution due to insufficient validation of user input when merging properties, specifically because the `constructor` property was not blocked alongside `__proto__`, allowing an attacker to inject properties into `Object.prototype` by crafting an object with a `constructor` property that points to an Object prototype, which can then be used to manipulate the `prototype` property of a newly created object and pollute the prototype chain, potentially leading to denial of service, bypassing security checks, or remote code execution.",
