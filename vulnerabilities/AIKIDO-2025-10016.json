  "tldr": "New connections to a server managed by the `phrity/websocket` library have a small but intermittent chance of causing the server to enter an infinite loop. This results in 100% CPU usage and blocks all server operations, including handling both new and existing connections. The server remains unresponsive until it is manually restarted or a timeout handler is implemented and triggered. This issue occurs only during the processing of new connections and does not affect connections that are already established.",
