  "tldr": "Using the same encryption key to encrypt an unlimited amount of data/documents results in key wear-out, in particular when using AES-CBC or other cipher modes that are not very resistant to nonce misuse. The patch version derives from the application secret a fresh encryption key and a fresh initialization vector for every document to encrypt. HKDF is used to derive these values and the context info parameter is set to a fresh random value called nonce. This nonce replaces the IV in the token.",
