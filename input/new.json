  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package contain a Command Injection in turbo-ignore Git Ref Validation vulnerability, where the use of `execSync` with shell commands allowed user-supplied git references from environment variables to be interpreted as shell commands. The fix replaces `execSync` with `execFileSync` to ensure inputs are treated as literal arguments. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious git ref value (e.g., containing `; rm -rf /`) within a controlled environment variable, which would then be executed with the application's privileges when the validation script runs.",
