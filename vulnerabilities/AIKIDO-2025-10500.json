  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site scripting (XSS) via unsanitized URL injection in the `history.pushState` function. The vulnerability occurs when `window.location.href` is directly embedded into the HTML template without proper encoding, allowing attackers to craft malicious URLs containing JavaScript payloads. When a victim visits a manipulated link (e.g.,` https://victim.site/?\"></script><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`), the payload executes within the application context, enabling session hijacking, data theft, or malicious actions.",
