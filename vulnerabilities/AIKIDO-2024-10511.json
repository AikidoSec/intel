  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package lack default protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF). To mitigate this vulnerability, users of versions starting from `4.9.0` can explicitly enable protection by setting `security.checkOrigin` to `true` in the configuration, lower versions are not protected. The patched version addresses this issue by enabling CSRF protection by default. Updating to the latest version or adjusting the configuration is recommended to prevent unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.",
