  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package may expose sensitive cookie information due to the absence of the `HttpOnly` flag in the `create_token_cookie` function. Without this flag, compatible browsers may allow client-side scripts to access the cookie, increasing the risk of data exfiltration in the event of a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Setting the `HttpOnly` attribute in the `Set-Cookie` HTTP response header instructs supporting browsers to restrict cookie access from JavaScript, thereby mitigating the risk of client-side attacks attempting to read and leak sensitive authentication tokens or session data.",
