  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to incorrect permission assignment when using Aspects with the default execution order. An attacker can assign `DEFAULT` permissions to a custom Aspect, which may be overridden by a built-in CDK method using `MUTATING` permissions. This can cause the custom Aspect to have either fewer or, in permissive environments, more permissions than expected.",
