  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Unsafe Reflection via `invoke()` Validation Bypass, where the `invoke()` function skips the validation logic intended to restrict access to internal attributes such as `__globals__` or `__builtins__`, allowing for unsafe reflection. An attacker could exploit this by crafting malicious inputs to invoke() to access these internals, potentially leading to information disclosure or remote code execution.",
