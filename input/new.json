  "tldr": "The aes_key_unwrap function would panic if passed a ciphertext that was too short. In a debug build, it would panic due to a subtraction underflow. In a release build, it would use the small negative quantity to allocate a vector. Since the allocator expects an unsigned quantity, the negative value would be interpreted as a huge allocation. The allocator would then fail to allocate the memory and panic. An attacker could trigger this panic by sending a victim an encrypted message whose PKESK or SKESK packet has been specially modified. When the victim decrypts the message, the program would crash.",
