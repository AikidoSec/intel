  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the `setByDotNotation` utility function, where the lack of validation for user-controlled dot-notation paths allows an attacker to exploit it by injecting dangerous keys like `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype` to mutate `Object.prototype`, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS), logic bypasses, or even Remote Code Execution (RCE).",
