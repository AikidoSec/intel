  "tldr": "The `rustls-pemfile` crate is no longer maintained and has been archived since August 2025. The maintainer recommends using the built-in PEM parsing functionality provided directly by `rustls-pki-types` (available since version 1.9.0). Because the latest `rustls-pemfile` release is already just a thin wrapper around the same parsing code, migrating to `rustls-pki-types` should be straightforward.",
  "how_to_fix": "Remove any `rustls-pemfile` package from your application. Please take a look at the <a href=\"https://docs.rs/rustls-pki-types/latest/rustls_pki_types/pem/trait.PemObject.html\">PemObject</a> trait, which provides methods for reading a single or multiple PEM objects from a file or byte slice.",
