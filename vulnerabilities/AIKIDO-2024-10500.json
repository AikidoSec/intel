  "tldr": "Affected versions of `check-jsonschema` are vulnerable to a cache confusion attack due to the default cache strategy, which stores remote schemas using their basename (e.g., `https://example.org/schema.json` as `schema.json`). This can lead to conflicts if an attacker tricks a user into validating against a malicious schema with the same name (e.g., `https://example.evil.org/schema.json`). As a result, the attackerâ€™s schema may be used instead, allowing invalid data to pass validation. This issue is patched in version 0.30.0. You should update to the latest version or apply workarounds such as disabling caching with `--no-cache`, specifying cache filenames with `--cache-filename` (deprecated), or downloading schemas locally before validation.",
