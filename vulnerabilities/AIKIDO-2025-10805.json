  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to cache poisoning and host header manipulation due to insufficient validation of `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and `X-Forwarded-Port` headers. Attackers could inject or manipulate these headers to bypass domain restrictions, influence routing, or poison caches. The fix introduces strict validation logic—including sanitizing hostnames, validating protocols and ports against allowed domains, and rejecting invalid or path-injection style values.",
