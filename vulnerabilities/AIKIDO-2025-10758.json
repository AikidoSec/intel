  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to information disclosure due to unsanitized logging of Elasticsearch and Meilisearch connection strings. Because these connection strings can include credentials (e.g., `protocol://username:password@host:port`), sensitive information such as passwords could be exposed in plain text in log files. The fix wraps all instances of `setting.Indexer.RepoConnStr` and `setting.Indexer.IssueConnStr` with the `util.SanitizeCredentialURLs()` function to remove credentials before logging.",
