HashiCorp Vaultâ€™s Shamir secret sharing implementation relies on precomputed table lookups, making it susceptible to cache-timing attacks. An attacker with access to the host and the ability to monitor a large number of unseal operations via a side channel can significantly reduce the search space for brute-force recovery of Shamir shares.",
