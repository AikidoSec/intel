  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) because the `SmolAgentsAdapter` directly interpolates untrusted MCP server responses into a dynamically generated Python class and executes it with `exec()`. An attacker who can control or spoof MCP responses can inject arbitrary Python code that will run in the application's process, leading to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or further lateral movement.",
