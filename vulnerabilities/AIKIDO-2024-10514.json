  "tldr" : "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) due to the lack of bounds checking on `n` when traversing a `Map` to retrieve the `n`th item. Without validation, an excessively large `n` can exhaust the iterator, leading to excessive resource consumption. Since this function is used in multiple locations, malicious actors can exploit it to disrupt system performance.",
