  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable due to the use of a compromised dependency, as described in CVE-2024-21538. The issue arises from `child-process-promise`, which relies on an insecure version of `cross-spawn`. This has been addressed by migrating from the unmaintained `child-process-promise` to `promisify-child-process`, eliminating the transitive vulnerability in `cross-spawn`.",
