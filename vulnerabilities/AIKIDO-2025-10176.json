  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to prototype pollution, allowing an attacker to inject properties such as `isAdmin` into an object's prototype when merging an object containing a `__proto__` property using the `mergeRecursively` function of the `merge-anything` library. This can lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and unpredictable application behavior due to bypassed permission checks. To mitigate this issue, applications should explicitly filter out keys like `__proto__`, `prototype`, and `constructor`. Given the library's widespread usage, multiple use cases may be affected by this vulnerability.",
