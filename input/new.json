  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) due to unbounded parameter parsing in `Rack::QueryParser`, which can lead to memory exhaustion. Although default limits are set —4096 parameters and a 4MB byte size— these may be insufficient for certain applications. To improve flexibility and mitigate this risk, the limits can be overridden per `QueryParser` instance via its constructor or globally using the environment variables `RACK_QUERY_PARSER_BYTESIZE_LIMIT` and `RACK_QUERY_PARSER_PARAMS_LIMIT`. If limits are exceeded, a `Rack::QueryParser::QueryLimitError` is raised.",
