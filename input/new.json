  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to an inefficient regex pattern in the `last_years` matcher, which allowed catastrophic backtracking. An attacker could exploit this by crafting malicious input like `'last ' + '1'.repeat(100) + ' years'`, causing exponential backtracking that stalls the event loop and leads to denial of service. This occurs because the original pattern ambiguously splits digits between `d*` and `d+` when no decimal is present, creating excessive computation paths.",
