  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an integer overflow in the `fake_exponential` function, which is used to calculate blob gas prices per EIP-4844. The vulnerability occurs when `numerator_accum * numerator` exceeds `u128::MAX`, causing the function to panic on arithmetic overflow. This can be triggered by processing blocks with intentionally invalid excess blob gas values near `u64::MAX`, potentially leading to denial of service.",
