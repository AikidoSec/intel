  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect due to improper sanitization of the `returnURL` query parameter in the login functionality. The vulnerability allows attackers to craft malicious links that redirect authenticated users to arbitrary external domains after login, as demonstrated by accessing a URL like `https://myapp.com/manage-prototype/password?returnURL=%2F%2Fevil.com`. Exploitation occurs when a victim logs in via such a manipulated link, enabling phishing attacks where the attacker can steal credentials or distribute malware by redirecting users to a malicious site under their control.",
