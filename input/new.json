Any user who accesses the paths provided by `GuardedModelAdminMixin` can view, add, change, and delete guardian permissions for any user, regardless of whether the current user has the necessary guardian permissions. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to manipulate permissions, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the system.",
