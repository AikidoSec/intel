  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Path Traversal because the `embedded_get` functionality does not properly sanitize the user-controlled path parameter. This allows an attacker to craft a path containing directory traversal sequences, potentially causing files to be written outside the intended working directory or to overwrite existing files. The issue is mitigated by introducing stricter path validation: by default, the command now refuses to write to an existing file or to any location outside the current directory. Writing outside these constraints is only possible when explicitly allowed via the `-output` option or the newly introduced `-unsafe` flag, making the security impact opt-in and explicit.",
