  "tldr": "WolfSSH’s key exchange state machine can be manipulated, allowing an attacker to leak the client’s password in clear text, coerce the client into generating a bogus signature, or bypass user authentication entirely. Users of wolfSSH are advised to update to a fixed version or apply the provided patch. As a precaution, it is also recommended to rotate any credentials that may have been exposed. The fix should likewise be applied to wolfSSH server applications: although no specific server-side attacks are currently known, the same underlying defect is present.",
