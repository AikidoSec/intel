  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are affected by unsafe authentication and secret comparisons due to the lack of cryptographic comparison safe methods usage, resulting in noticeable timing discrepancies when handling user login specifically. Attackers can exploit these differences by measuring response times and error variations, which may allow them to infer credentials or keys. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or user enumeration.",
