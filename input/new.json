  "tldr": "Affected versions of the `undici` library are vulnerable because they use insufficiently random values generated by `Math.random()` when encoding form-data in the body. Since `Math.random()` produces low-entropy and predictable values, attackers could potentially exploit this flaw to manipulate or alter data by predicting the encoded values. This vulnerability compromises the integrity of form-data, potentially leading to unauthorized data manipulation or injection attacks.",
