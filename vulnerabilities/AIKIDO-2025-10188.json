  "tldr": "Affected versions of this crate improperly validate the index argument of `HashTable::get_bucket` and `HashTable::get_chain`, checking it only against the input-controlled `bucket_count` and `chain_count` fields but not against the actual size of the ELF section. Consequently, a malformed ELF file can trigger out-of-bounds reads in applications using the `HashTable` API by setting these fields to excessively large values that extend beyond the hash table section and introducing corresponding out-of-bounds indexes elsewhere in the ELF file.",
