  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an XSS vulnerability when setting editor value via `writeValue()`, where the `refreshView()` method unsafely sets innerHTML without sanitization, bypassing the `sanitize: true` configuration and allowing XSS payloads to execute; this affects all programmatic value setting methods, including `ngModel binding`, `FormControl setValue/patchValue`, and direct property `assignment`. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by inserting a malicious payload into the editor and toggling the preview mode, which can trigger the execution of JavaScript code.",
