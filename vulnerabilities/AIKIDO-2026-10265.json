  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package allowed `@use_request_token(scope=\"...\")` to be applied without explicitly setting `required`, which previously defaulted to `False` and silently allowed token-less requests to pass through, creating a misleading access-control footgun. An attacker could exploit this by calling endpoints decorated with `@use_request_token(...)` without providing any token, bypassing the intended token-gated protection and reaching privileged handlers to read sensitive data or trigger unauthorized state-changing actions, depending on what those routes expose.",
  "doest_this_affect_me": "You are affected if you are using a version that falls within the vulnerable range or if you didn't explicitly set `required=True` on endpoints or views that rely on token validation.",
  "how_to_fix": "Upgrade the `django-request-token` library to the patch version or set `required=True`.",
