  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to XSS via unescaped session variables due to improper output sanitization of HTML-injectable session parameters `error` and `message`, where the code directly injects session content without escaping. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious payloads into these session variables, typically by manipulating error-triggering operations, such as failed logins, which are then rendered and executed in victims' browsers when they view the error page, enabling session hijacking or credential theft.",
