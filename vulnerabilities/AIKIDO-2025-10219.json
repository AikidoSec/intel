  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to improper certificate validation during optional TLS 1.3 client authentication. In Mbed TLS 3.6.0, the function `mbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result()` fails to correctly report missing `digitalSignature` or `clientAuth` flags in the client's certificate, returning 0 even when the certificate should be considered invalid. This allows an attacker to use a certificate valid for other purposes (but not for client authentication) to bypass verification checks. This issue does not affect mandatory authentication, TLS 1.2, or TLS 1.3 server authentication.",
  "doest_this_affect_me": "You are affected if you are using a version that falls within the vulnerable range.",
  "how_to_fix": "Affected users should upgrade to Mbed TLS `3.6.1`. As a workaround, servers using optional client authentication should enforce TLS 1.2 by setting the maximum TLS version to `MBEDTLS_SSL_VERSION_TLS1_2`.",
