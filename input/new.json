  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to improper escaping of parameter values. If an attacker injects a specially crafted value containing quotes and JavaScript code, it could be executed within the application. For example, a value like `\"-alert(window.location.href)-\"` could bypass protections and execute malicious scripts. To mitigate this, the fix ensures that special characters, including quotes, are properly escaped using `html_escape`, converting them to their HTML entity equivalents while preserving the intended functionality.",
