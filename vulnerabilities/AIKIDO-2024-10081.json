  "tldr": "Affected versions of the `oauth4webapi` library are vulnerable to authentication bypass by capture-replay because the DPoP (demonstrating proof of possession) `iat` (issued at) timestamp is not checked. This flaw allows a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying the captured message to the server, achieving the same effect as the original request (or with minimal changes).",
