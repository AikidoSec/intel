  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal due to insufficient sanitization of the `session_id` and `agent_id` parameters in the `FileSessionManager._get_session_path()`, `FileSessionManager._get_agent_path()`, `S3SessionManager._get_session_path()`, and `S3SessionManager._get_agent_path()` functions. Attackers can exploit this by providing crafted identifiers that manipulate file paths, potentially bypassing authentication and gaining unauthorized access to files in restricted directories.",
