  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to path traversal when extracting embedded files using the `embed-extract` functionality. Crafted embedded file names or metadata can cause files to be written outside the intended output directory or overwrite existing files on the filesystem. This can lead to unauthorized file modification and potential abuse in environments where untrusted documents are processed. The issue is fixed by restricting extraction paths to the current working directory by default and preventing overwriting of existing files unless an explicit unsafe option is provided.",
