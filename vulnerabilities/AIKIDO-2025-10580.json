  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-bounds Access due to improper bounds checking when handling partial writes in vectored I/O. The vulnerability occurs when processing the first frame in the queue: if `bytes_written` exceeds the header length but is larger than the payload length, the unsafe `get_unchecked` call attempts to create a slice starting beyond the payload buffer boundaries. An attacker could exploit this by sending a large number of messages rapidly, triggering partial writes and causing the `bytes_written` value to corrupt memory or read out-of-bounds data, potentially leading to a denial of service or information disclosure.",
