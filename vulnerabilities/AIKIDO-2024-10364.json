  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to improper authentication due to insecure code in the `PKIAuthenticationPlugin` and `HttpSolrCall` classes. An attacker can bypass the authentication process by appending a fake ending to the URL path. Although the path appears to be an unprotected API endpoint, it is internally stripped off after authentication and before API routing, allowing unauthorized access.",
