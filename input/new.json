  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to improper request routing when using `PathPrefix`, `Path`, or `PathRegex` matchers: if a request path contains an encoded restricted character such as `%2F`, `%00`, `%3B`, `%3F`, or `%23`, an attacker can bypass the intended router and reach a backend exposed by another route without passing through the associated middleware chain. For example, with a route protected by security middleware under `PathPrefix('/admin/')`, a request to `/admin%2F` will be routed to the backend service without invoking the `my-security-middleware`, effectively bypassing the protections configured for the `/admin/` path. This results in a loss of access control and may expose sensitive endpoints.",
