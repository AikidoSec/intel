  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package may expose sensitive information by unintentionally forwarding the client API key to OAuth providers. When both `Authorization` and `x-api-key` headers are present, only the `Authorization` header is removed, allowing the API key to be leaked to upstream services. This change ensures both headers are stripped before provider-specific credentials are applied, preventing unintended disclosure of authentication data.",
