The middleware bypasses authorization checks for internal requests but fails to adequately validate whether the requests are genuinely internal, enabling attackers to impersonate internal requests and circumvent access controls. An attacker could craft a malicious request with a fake internal flag, gaining unauthorized access to protected routes or critical system functionalities.",
