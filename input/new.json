  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a Regular Expression Injection via a crafted payload beginning with a forward slash (`/`), where the mechanism that wraps regex-like strings in double quotes fails to escape existing internal quotes. An attacker can exploit this by supplying an input like `/foo\"; console.log(-1); \"/`, where the unescaped quote (`\"`) after `foo` breaks out of the generated string literal, allowing arbitrary JavaScript code execution within contexts like `eval` or inline `<script>` tags, as the repaired output becomes is valid, executable code.",
