  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) in the `Order` element. In the `getMetadata()` method of the `src/elements/Order.php` class, several metadata fields such as `reference`, `couponCode`, `order site`, `shipping method`, and `origin` are included in the output without proper HTML encoding. This allows attackers to inject malicious HTML or script content that executes in the user’s browser when the metadata is rendered.",
