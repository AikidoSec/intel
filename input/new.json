  "tldr": "NumPyâ€™s default integer type on Windows is `int32`, which can cause integer overflows in operations like `np.prod((60000, 60000))`, returning incorrect negative values. In `flatten_tensor`, Python integers are generally cast to `int64`, but one instance applies this conversion too late, after the overflow has already occurred. Explicitly setting `dtype=np.int64` in `np.prod` prevents this issue by ensuring calculations use 64-bit integers.",
