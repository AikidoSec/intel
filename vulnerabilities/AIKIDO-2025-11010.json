  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to improper validation of Ed25519 elliptic-curve points due to a flaw in `crypto_core_ed25519_is_valid_point()`, which fails to correctly reject certain invalid inputs. This can lead to incorrect behavior in applications that directly rely on this low-level function with untrusted data. High-level cryptographic APIs are not impacted.",
