  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to remote code execution during compilation when processing maliciously crafted input with plugins that use the internal `path.evaluate()` or `path.evaluateTruthy()` methods. Impacted plugins include `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`, `@babel/preset-env` with the `useBuiltIns` option, and any polyfill provider plugin based on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`. Users compiling only trusted code are not affected.",
