  "tldr" : "Affected versions of this package set overly permissive file permissions in `luigi/lock.py`, setting the file permissions of the `pid_dir` directory to `0o777` in the `acquire_for function`. On POSIX systems, file permissions should be strictly limited to prevent unauthorized access by other users. However, these permissive settings allow others to access the file's contents, creating a potential security risk. This issue could also be exploited to write or execute malicious code, potentially leading to privilege escalation.",
