  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to improper access control because a certain admin API action (`web2print_web2print_favourite_output_channels`) does not enforce server-side permission checks, allowing an authenticated backend user without the appropriate rights to invoke those endpoints and view restricted resources. The patch adds explicit permission checks in the relevant `AdminController` action to ensure that only users with the correct privileges can perform these operations.",
