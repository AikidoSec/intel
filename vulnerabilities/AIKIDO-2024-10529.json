  "tldr" : "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to path traversal due to improper handling of paths in the `RuntimeContext` class within the `semantic_release/cli/config.py` file. The vulnerability arises from using `Path.resolve()` without `Path.absolute()`, which may return relative paths on Windows for non-existent directories. Exploiting this flaw could allow attackers to access or modify files outside the intended repository directory, potentially compromising the system's integrity or exposing sensitive data.",
