An attacker could exploit this by querying the API to enumerate or retrieve data from soft-deleted posts or restricted records before masking and locking were enforced. By abusing predictable identifiers or filters, unauthorized users could access confidential fields that should have been hidden or protected by proper authorization checks.",
