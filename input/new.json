If an attacker can supply malformed or non-UTF-8 encoded data, the application may encounter an unexpected runtime panic, potentially leading to a denial of service. This occurs because the package does not properly validate or handle invalid UTF-8 sequences before attempting operations that assume valid encoding.",
