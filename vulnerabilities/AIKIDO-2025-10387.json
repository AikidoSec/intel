  "tldr": "The affected versions use a polynomial-time regular expression within the `moveSpaces` function, which can lead to performance issues when processing specially crafted input. Specifically, the regular expression exhibits catastrophic backtracking, where certain patterns cause the regex engine to perform excessive computations. An attacker could exploit this by supplying input that triggers worst-case performance, leading to high CPU usage and making the application vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. This type of vulnerability can degrade system performance or make the application temporarily unavailable.",
