An attacker can craft a malicious URL and trick a user into visiting it, enabling the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victimâ€™s browser. This can result in the theft of session cookies and administrative tokens, as well as allow the attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the affected user.",
