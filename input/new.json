  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to multiple cross-site scripting issues due to insufficient input validation and output encoding at several points in the codebase. User-controlled data can be rendered without proper sanitization in different execution paths, allowing injected scripts to execute in a victim’s browser. The fix addresses these issues by tightening validation and applying appropriate escaping at all affected locations, ensuring untrusted input is safely handled throughout the application.",
