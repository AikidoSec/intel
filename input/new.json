  "tldr": "This update adds sanitization to the `debug_toolbar`'s Request Panel, ensuring sensitive data such as GET, POST, cookies, and session values are redacted in debug output. The `RequestPanel.generate_stats` method now uses a new `sanitize_and_sort_request_vars` utility to replace the earlier unsanitized approach. Supporting helper functions (`_get_sorted_keys`, `_process_query_dict`, `_process_dict`) were introduced to clean and organize request data securely.",
