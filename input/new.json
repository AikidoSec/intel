If an attacker gains access to any user account, they can exploit these vulnerabilities to inject and execute arbitrary system commands. It could lead to a complete system takeover, cryptocurrency mining, or the retrieval of malicious payloads from external domains. Although the maintainers have disabled this feature by default in the patched version, any installations made before the update remain exposed unless manually secured.",
