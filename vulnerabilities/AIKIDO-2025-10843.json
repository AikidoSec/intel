  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) due to inefficient patterns in `parse-incomplete-markdown.ts`. These expressions allow crafted input to trigger excessive backtracking and degrade performance. The fix removes the vulnerable regexes and replaces them with safer, deterministic string-based parsing logic for handling incomplete links, images, and other partial markdown constructs, eliminating the risk of ReDoS.",
