  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) because `createRequestUrl` uses `new URL(originalUrl ?? url, base)` and allows schema-relative paths (`//host`) to override the base. An attacker can craft a request path beginning with `//` (e.g. `//attacker.com/path`), causing Angular SSR to treat the request as coming from `http://attacker.com` and perform relative requests against attacker-controlled hosts. This enables SSRF, domain spoofing, and potential content injection.",
