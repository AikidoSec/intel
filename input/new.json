  "tldr": "Affected versions of the `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Threading` library are vulnerable to a race condition due to the lack of guaranteed ordering when reading `this.joinableTask` in the lock-free section of the logic. Under certain race conditions, `AsyncLazy` may wait on the inner task instead of the joinable task when two threads access this code simultaneously, potentially causing the program to hang and leading to a denial of service (DoS).",
