  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to null byte injection. In PHP 7, the `DateTime::createFromFormat` function allows null byte injection, while in PHP 8, it throws a `ValueError` that is not properly caught. This vulnerability can allow attackers to manipulate date and time input, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security issues. The fix addresses this by preventing null byte injection in PHP 7.x by throwing a `TransformationFailedException`, ensuring proper input validation and safeguarding against such attacks.",
