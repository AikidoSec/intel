  "tldr": "Affected versions of `wolfssl` include Curve25519 blinding support enabled by default in applicable builds, providing additional protection against potential side-channel attacks. While practical private-key extraction via side channels is considered difficult, blinding helps reduce the risk on devices that may be exposed to physical access or side-channel observation, improving overall cryptographic robustness.",
