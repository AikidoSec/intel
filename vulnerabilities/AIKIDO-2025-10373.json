  "tldr": "Affected versions of the `github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets` library are vulnerable to sensitive data exposure due to the inclusion of certain `sprig` template functions. Specifically, the `env` and `expandenv` functions could expose controller environment variables containing secrets, while `getHostByName` allowed DNS resolution from within templates, which may be unsafe in certain environments. The patch removes these functions to prevent unintended information disclosure and improve security.",
