  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a HostPort Traffic Hijack via the CNI portmap plugin's `nftables` backend, where the plugin incorrectly configures rules to forward all network traffic destined for a specific port to a container that requested HostPort mapping, regardless of the destination IP address. It allows a malicious container to intercept sensitive traffic intended for other containers or services on the same node. An attacker could exploit this by deploying a pod that requests a common service port, enabling them to capture, monitor, or manipulate traffic meant for legitimate pods on that host, potentially leading to data theft or service disruption.",
