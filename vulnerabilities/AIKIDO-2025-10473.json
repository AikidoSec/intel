  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS). The module fails to properly validate \"disabled JavaScript\" entries, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript by submitting invalid or non-existent script references, which the module attempts to process. The vulnerability is mitigated by the requirement that an attacker must have a role with the \"Administer EU Cookie Compliance banner\" permission.",
