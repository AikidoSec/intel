  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package contain a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the search results rendering function due to unsafely setting `innerHTML` with user-controlled data from `r.item.title` or `r.item.excerpt`. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious search entry where the title or excerpt contains a script payload. When the results are displayed, this payload would be injected into the DOM and executed in the victim's browser, potentially compromising their session.",
