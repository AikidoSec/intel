  "tldr": "Affected versions are vulnerable to replay attacks and double spending due to missing transaction ID verification in the Saman payment driver's `verify()` method. Without this check, an attacker could potentially reuse a successful payment response or process the same payment multiple times, resulting in financial losses. The issue is resolved by comparing the stored transaction ID with the `ResNum` value returned by the payment gateway and automatically reversing the transaction if they do not match, thereby ensuring that each payment response corresponds to a valid and unique transaction.",
