  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to denial of service via malicious .zip archives in OpenTofu's tofu init, where high CPU usage occurs when processing crafted archives from attacker-controlled sources during module or provider installation, leading to failed or delayed dependency installation and system performance degradation. An attacker can exploit this by serving such archives from a controlled source and coercing an OpenTofu operator to install dependencies from that source, though the vulnerability does not permit arbitrary code execution or data disclosure.",
