  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to unsafe deserialization due to the use of `numpy.load` with `allow_pickle=True` when loading NPZ files. Since this function relies on pickle for deserialization, it poses a security risk when handling untrusted data. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious model file, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution when unsuspecting users load the model in `keras`.",
