  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to arbitrary file upload. Even when an upload is explicitly disallowed and the system correctly reports that the file should not be accepted, the file is still written to the temporary directory (`storage/runtime/temp`). This allows an attacker to place unexpected or malicious files on the server, potentially enabling further exploitation depending on server configuration and how temporary files are handled.",
