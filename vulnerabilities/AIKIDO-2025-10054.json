  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are affected by a design flaw when handling lazy imports that allow a malicious `.whl` file to overwrite critical modules, such as `pip/_internal/self_outdated_check.py`, during installation. When `pip` dynamically imports the modified module, the rogue code executes, enabling arbitrary code execution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to force systems to install untrusted packages or execute malicious code.",
