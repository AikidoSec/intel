  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks due to insecure handling of XML in the `HTMLSectionSplitter` component. This vulnerability allows attackers to read sensitive local files (such as SSH keys, passwords, or configuration files), perform server-side request forgery (SSRF), and exfiltrate data to external servers. The issue stems from the use of the `xslt_path` parameter and insecure parser configurations. The fix removes the `xslt_path` parameter and hardens the XML/HTML parsers with secure settings.",
