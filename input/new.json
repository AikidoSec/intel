  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an authorization bypass due to improper detection of method security annotations on parameterized types or overridden methods. When using `@EnableMethodSecurity`, if security annotations are applied to a parameterized superclass, interface, or overridden method—without being explicitly defined on the target method—Spring Security may fail to enforce access control, allowing unauthorized access.",
  "doest_this_affect_me": "You are affected if using a vulnerable version, while applications remain unaffected if they do not use `@EnableMethodSecurity`, avoid applying method security annotations to parameterized types or methods, and explicitly attach all security annotations to target methods.",
  "how_to_fix": "Upgrade the `spring-security-config` library to the patch version. If upgrading is not an option, you can either ensure annotations are placed on the target method instead of its parameterized ancestor or publish an `AuthorizationManagerBeforeMethodInterceptor` to correctly detect annotations on parameterized types.",
