  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to credential leakage due to improper sanitization of the `Authorization` header. When forwarding client requests to upstream providers, the header was not removed, causing client credentials to be exposed to third-party APIs. The fix ensures that client `Authorization` headers are stripped when provider credentials are present.",
