  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to arbitrary code execution via insecure deserialization. The vulnerability exists because the `CheckpointLoader` and similar mechanisms that load training checkpoints do not use the security restriction `weights_only=True`. It allows the deserialization of arbitrary Python objects. An attacker can exploit this by distributing a malicious checkpoint file that contains a serialized payload designed to execute arbitrary commands when loaded.",
