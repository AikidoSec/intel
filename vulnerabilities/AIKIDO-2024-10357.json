  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to code injection due to improper handling of byte lengths in the PostgreSQL binary protocol. Clients that fail to check the length of bytes before encoding the 4-length bytes allow attackers to send data greater than 2^32, causing an overflow. This overflow enables the smuggling of an additional message, potentially leading to code execution or other malicious behavior.",
