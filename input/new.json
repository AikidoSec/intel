  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to use of incorrectly resolved names or references through dynamic tool-module registration in `ToolLoader`. The `load_tools_from_file_path` and `load_python_tools` helpers insert tool modules into `sys.modules` using names derived directly from the file’s `base_name` or the provided `tool_name`, without validation or namespacing. An attacker can register a tool whose name matches a standard library or internal module, overwriting that entry in `sys.modules` and hijacking subsequent imports, which can silently modify SDK or application behavior.",
