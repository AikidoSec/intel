  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Disclosure, where the 'photoId' attribute was improperly included in the safe attributes list, allowing attackers to exploit mass assignment mechanisms to read or manipulate photo identifiers, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive image data. The patch resolves this by explicitly removing 'photoId' from the safe attributes array using ArrayHelper::withoutValue.",
