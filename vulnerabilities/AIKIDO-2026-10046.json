  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to prototype pollution issues in the transport loading mechanism due to unsafe access to `globalThis.__bundlerPathsOverrides`. The use of the `in` operator and a default `{}` object allows prototype chain manipulation, which can influence transport resolution logic. This can be abused by an attacker to alter application behavior. The fix hardens the implementation by using `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call()` and a prototype-less fallback object to prevent prototype chain pollution.",
