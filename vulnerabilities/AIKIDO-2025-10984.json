  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an integer overflow vulnerability via the `ogg_sync_buffer` function, where a `long` type variable (`newsize`) could exceed the maximum value storable in an `int` (`oy->storage`), causing the internal buffer allocation to succeed. Still, the stored buffer size overflows and wraps to a small value. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted input that triggers the overflow, resulting in a mismatch between the actual allocated buffer size and the recorded storage value. It could then cause subsequent operations to write beyond the allocated buffer's bounds, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow, application crash, or arbitrary code execution. The patched code mitigates this by adding a check (`if(size>INT_MAX-4096-oy->fill)`) to fail safely before the overflow can occur.",
