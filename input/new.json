  "tldr": "Several vulnerabilities were found and fixed in the `sitemap` library. The update introduces comprehensive input validation, centralized security limits, and enhanced XML sanitization to prevent cross-site scripting via malformed attributes. It adds strict URL, numeric, and date validation to mitigate injection and denial-of-service risks, blocks protocol and path traversal attacks, and enforces limits on sitemap size and resource counts. Additional fixes include prevention of command injection in `xmllint`, stricter hostname and namespace validation in streams, and improvements to number and date handling across utilities.",
