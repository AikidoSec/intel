  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to integer overflow in `absl::{flat,node}_hash_{set,map}` during container creation or resizing via constructors, `reserve()`, or `rehash()`. These methods fail to enforce upper bounds on size arguments, potentially causing overflows when allocating the backing store and leading to out-of-bounds memory access. The fix introduces proper validation of size arguments and updates `max_size()` to reflect safe limits. While exploitation is considered difficult due to limited attacker control over container sizes, applications using untrusted input should upgrade to a patched version.",
