  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Undefined Behavior in time duration rounding calculations due to improper use of unsafe Rust code. The vulnerability occurs when `unit_length` is zero, which triggers undefined behavior when passed to `NonZeroU128::new_unchecked` without validation. An attacker could exploit this by providing malicious input that results in a zero `unit_length` value, potentially causing application crashes or memory corruption depending on how the undefined behavior manifests in the execution environment.",
