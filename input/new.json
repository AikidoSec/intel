  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) because malformed TAR headers in compressed files can be misinterpreted as LongName/LongLink entries with multi-gigabyte sizes, causing excessive memory allocation. The fix adds a 32KB `MAX_LONG_NAME_SIZE` limit and validates sizes before allocation, rejecting invalid headers with an `InvalidFormatException`. A regression test ensures that oversized (e.g., 8GB) fake headers now fail safely instead of exhausting memory.",
