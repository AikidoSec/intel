  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to accepting unsafe remote WebSocket links in the `hybrid_browser_toolkit` WebSocket server, which could be abused to connect to arbitrary remote hosts; this patch tightens validation of the base URL in the WebSocket server to only allow `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, preventing remote links and mitigating potential server-side request forgery or unauthorized access via manipulated WebSocket connections.",
