  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to a crash due to improper error handling when `async_hooks.createHook()` is enabled. Under specific conditions involving deep recursion, a “Maximum call stack size exceeded” error becomes uncatchable and bypasses `process.on('uncaughtException')`, causing the Node.js process to terminate unexpectedly. Applications using `AsyncLocalStorage` or `async_hooks.createHook()` can therefore be forced into an unrecoverable denial-of-service condition.",
