  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to the lack of a `ReadHeaderTimeout` configuration in the HTTP transport inbound. Without this setting, the server is exposed to slow header attacks, where an attacker sends HTTP headers at a slow rate to tie up resources. The patch introduces support for configuring `ReadHeaderTimeout`, enabling users to set a maximum duration for reading request headers and enhancing the serverâ€™s resilience against such attacks.",
