  "tldr" : "Affected versions of the `next` package are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) due to a flaw in the image optimization functionality. The Image Optimization API checks if the given image URL is relative by verifying if `url.startsWith('/')`. This allows protocol-relative URLs (e.g., `//example.com`) to bypass the check and be treated as relative. As a result, these URLs skip validation against remote patterns and are processed as relative URLs, potentially exposing the system to SSRF attacks.",
