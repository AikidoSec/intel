This security flaw involves improper management of authentication headers across all provider types, including OAuth, API key, Anthropic-compatible, and OpenAI-compatible providers. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could gain unauthorized access to client credentials by monitoring or manipulating requests to upstream providers, potentially leading to account takeover or further malicious activities.",
