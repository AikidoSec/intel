  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper sanitization of the version parameter in both `redoc_dashboard` and `swagger_dashboard` functions. These functions dynamically construct an `openapi_url` by embedding the user-supplied `version` value into the response without proper escaping, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. If an attacker crafts a malicious `version` parameter containing script payloads (e.g.,`?version='><script>alert(1)</script>`), the payload could execute in the victim's browser when the documentation is rendered.",
