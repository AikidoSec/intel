  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution due to insufficient validation of the `$arrow` parameter in the `groupFilter` method, where the old code allowed an unvalidated callable or string to be executed. An attacker could potentially exploit this by passing crafted malicious input that gets executed as code, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server. The patch mitigates this by implementing a validation check via `self::checkArrowFunction()` before processing the parameter.",
