  "tldr" : "Affected versions of the `n8n-core` package are vulnerable to code injection due to a bug in the `pdfjs-dist` dependency. If PDF.js is used to load a malicious PDF and is configured with `isEvalSupported` set to true (the default), unrestricted attacker-controlled JavaScript will be executed in the context of the hosting domain. In the fixed version, `n8n-core` mitigates this by setting `isEvalSupported` to `false`.",
