  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an integer overflow in the `Util.html_escape` method. The code stores segment lengths in a 16-bit integer (`uint16_t`), so a long unescaped segment (â‰¥ 65,536 bytes) can wrap the length value, causing incorrect `memcpy()` sizes and a buffer overrun. This may lead to memory corruption and a crash (denial of service), and in the worst case could enable further exploitation.",
