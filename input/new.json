  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via Insecure Input Deserialization due to the `decode` function using the `eval()` function on potential user-supplied input (`str`) without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker can exploit this by injecting malicious JavaScript code as the `str` argument, which will be directly evaluated and executed within the application's context, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
