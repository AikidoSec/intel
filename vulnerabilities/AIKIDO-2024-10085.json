  "tldr": "Affected versions of the `Werkzeug` package can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer's machine under certain circumstances. This requires the attacker to trick the developer into interacting with a domain and subdomain they control, and into entering the debugger PIN. If successful, the attacker can gain access to the debugger, even if it is only running on localhost. Additionally, the attacker must guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger.",
