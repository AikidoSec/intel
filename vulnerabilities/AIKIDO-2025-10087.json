  "tldr": "The `jwt.Parse` function previously used `strings.Split` to parse its argument, which is untrusted data, by splitting on periods. This allowed a malicious request with an `Authorization` header containing `Bearer` followed by numerous period characters to trigger excessive memory allocationsâ€”approximately O(n) bytes, where n is the length of the argument, with a constant factor of around 16. This patch optimizes `jwt.Parse` to allocate O(1) bytes, even when handling such malicious inputs.",
