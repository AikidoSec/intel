  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to replay attacks due to insufficient nonce implementation in the Google sign-in flow. Without proper nonce validation, an attacker could intercept authentication tokens during transmission and reuse them to impersonate legitimate users. It could allow unauthorized access to user accounts and associated data. The vulnerability exists because the nonce parameter is not properly generated or validated.",
