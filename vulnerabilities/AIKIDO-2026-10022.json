  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a Content-Encoding Chain Resource Exhaustion attack, where a malicious server can send an HTTP response with thousands of layered `Content-Encoding` headers, forcing the client to undergo excessive recursive decompression that consumes high CPU and memory resources, potentially leading to a denial-of-service. It was mitigated by limiting the permissible chain to 5 encodings.",
