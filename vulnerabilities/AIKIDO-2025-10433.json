If a request parameter contains a callable value such as `explode`, `phpinfo`, or any other invocable entity, `utopia-php/framework` may attempt to invoke it during request handling. This can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by supplying malicious input, due to insufficient validation of request-derived callables.",
