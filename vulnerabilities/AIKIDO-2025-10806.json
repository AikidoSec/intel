  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to unauthorized information disclosure due to flawed task naming validation. By naming a task “alloc,” an attacker could exploit filesystem directory naming consistency and gain access to another task’s directory within the same allocation, thereby bypassing isolation. The fix prohibits “alloc” as a task name and rejects job submissions using it.",
