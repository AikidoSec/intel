  "tldr": "The `expr-eval` library is a JavaScript expression parser and evaluator intended to safely process mathematical expressions with user-defined variables. However, due to insufficient input validation, attackers can supply a crafted variables object to the `evaluate()` function and achieve arbitrary code execution. Since the library is no longer maintained, users should migrate to the actively maintained fork `expr-eval-fork` version 3.0.0 or later.",
