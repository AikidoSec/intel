  "tldr": "Affected versions of `vm2` are vulnerable to a sandbox escape via promise callback sanitization bypass because the library did not correctly sanitize promise `then`/`catch` callback arguments, allowing untrusted code inside the sandbox to access host-level constructors (e.g., `Function`) and potentially escape the sandbox protections. PR #547 sanitizes these promise callback arguments so that values from untrusted code cannot leak host objects into the sandbox context, preventing this escape vector.",
