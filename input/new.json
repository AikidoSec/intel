  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow when calling `numpy.strings.find` on specific strings. The issue stems from an incorrect multiplication by `sizeof(npy_ucs4)`, which leads to improper memory allocation and potential out-of-bounds access. This flaw can result in application crashes or could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.",
