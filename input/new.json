  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to uninitialized memory read and leak in the fuser crate, specifically when creating a new libfuse session with `fuser::Session::new`, where the operation list is incorrectly passed as NULL instead of a valid pointer, causing libfuse to read and leak uninitialized memory. An attacker could exploit this by inducing the application to initialize a FUSE session, potentially disclosing sensitive data from heap memory, such as passwords or cryptographic keys, which might facilitate information disclosure or, in combination with other vulnerabilities, lead to code execution.",
  "doest_this_affect_me": "You are affected if you are using a version that falls within the vulnerable range and if you are using the affected function `fuser::Session::new` when creating a new libfuse session.",
