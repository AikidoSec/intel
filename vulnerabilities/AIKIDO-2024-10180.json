  "tldr": "A vulnerability in the `/v1/runs` API endpoint of `lightning-ai/pytorch-lightning` allows attackers to exploit path traversal when extracting tar.gz files. When the LightningApp runs with the plugin_server, attackers can deploy malicious tar.gz plugins that embed arbitrary files with path traversal vulnerabilities. This can lead to arbitrary files being written to any directory on the victim's local file system, potentially enabling Remote Code Execution (RCE).",
