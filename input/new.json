  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to improper enforcement of file size limits during uploads. An attacker can bypass the user-defined `max_file_size` by uploading a file with an excessively long filename, potentially exhausting server resources. This patch resolves the issue by correctly passing the `max_file_size` to the `MultiPartParser` through the `GradioMultiPartParser` class.",
