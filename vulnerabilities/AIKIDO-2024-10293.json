  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to open redirect due to improper handling of malformed URLs. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending a URL containing a comma (e.g., `http://example.com,/`) to the Validator, bypassing URL blocklist validation. This allows attackers to send requests to a blocklisted hostname, potentially leading to SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) and RCE (Remote Code Execution) attacks.",
