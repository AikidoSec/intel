  "tldr": "Affected versions of `redoc` are vulnerable to prototype pollution via the `Module.mergeObjects` function located in `redoc/bundles/redoc.lib.js` at line 2. The vulnerability occurs because the `mergeObjects()` method recursively copies properties from a source object to a destination object without implementing necessary security checks. As a result, an attacker can exploit this behavior to inject malicious properties into the built-in `Object.prototype` by leveraging special properties such as `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`. This prototype pollution can be further exploited to manipulate application logic, potentially leading to Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution, or Cross-site Scripting attacks.",
