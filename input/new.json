  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to improper validation in the `WorkloadAPI.ValidateJWTSVID` endpoint, where the expiration claim in `JWT-SVIDs` was not validated as required by the SPIFFE specification. By default, SPIRE does not issue `JWT-SVIDs` without an expiration claim, limiting impact; however, an attacker could exploit this by federating with a misconfigured or non-compliant trust domain to bypass expiration checks, potentially using indefinitely valid tokens for unauthorized access.",
