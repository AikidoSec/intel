  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to allocation of resources without proper limits or throttling. The `computeComplexity` function performs insufficient validation when the `ignoreIntrospection` option—enabled by default—is used. This allows an attacker to bypass query cost restrictions by naming a query or fragment using `__schema`, potentially leading to resource exhaustion.",
