  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in authentication handling. The vulnerability occurs when the `login` endpoint fails to properly sanitize parameters during authentication, allowing `URL-encoded scripts` to execute instead of returning expected errors. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious URL and tricking victims into clicking it, enabling arbitrary JavaScript execution in their browser session to steal credentials or hijack authentication tokens.",
