  "tldr": "Affected versions of Mbed TLS mistakenly document but do not implement support for `MBEDTLS_PSA_HMAC_DRBG_MD_TYPE`, causing the PSA subsystem to always use `CTR_DRBG` if `MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_C` is enabled, regardless of configuration. While both `HMAC_DRBG` and `CTR_DRBG` are cryptographically secure, `CTR_DRBG` may be more vulnerable to side-channel attacks in software implementations, potentially impacting users who explicitly prefer `HMAC_DRBG` for its stronger side-channel resistance.",
  "doest_this_affect_me": "You are affected if you are using a version that falls within the vulnerable range.",
  "how_to_fix": "Upgrade to a patched version, or as a workaround, disable the `MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_C` compile-time option to ensure that `HMAC_DRBG` is used as the pseudorandom generator in the PSA subsystem.",
