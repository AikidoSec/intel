  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package fail to properly validate security certificates. If the security tokens exist in the cookie storage, the `isAuthenticatedFactory()` function incorrectly returns `true` without verifying the expiration or issuer of the token. This flaw allows unauthorized access, as it bypasses essential security checks that should validate the integrity and validity of the token.",
