  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection due to insecure XML deserialization in the `load()` function in `Theme.java`. The code uses an `SAXParserFactory` without explicitly disabling external entity resolution, allowing an attacker to supply a crafted XML payload containing external entity references. This can result in unauthorized file access, server-side request forgery, or denial of service through resource exhaustion.",
