  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to incorrect authorization because `_check_proxy_admin_viewer_access` fails to enforce role boundaries. As a result, users granted the PROXY_ADMIN_VIEW_ONLY role—who should have read-only access—can perform privileged actions (for example, `POST /key/generate` or `POST /key/update`) by sending crafted requests, allowing them to modify credentials and other sensitive data.",
