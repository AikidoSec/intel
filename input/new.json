  "tldr": "In Headscale version `0.23.0` and earlier, OIDC user identification relies on either the \"username\" part of an email address (when `strip_email_domain` is true, the default) or the full email address (when `strip_email_domain` is false). This approach has the following issues:\n\n1. Account Takeover Risk: A malicious user with an Identity Provider (IdP) account can exploit the use of the email claim to take over another user's Headscale account, even if `strip_email_domain` is set to false.\n\n2. Account Access Loss: If a legitimate user changes their email address, they lose access to their Headscale account due to the reliance on the email claim.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are addressed in Headscale version `0.24.0`, which identifies OIDC users by the `iss` and `sub` claims. These claims are stable and unique as per the OIDC specification, ensuring account integrity and persistence even if a user's email address changes.",
