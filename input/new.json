  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to information disclosure due to insufficient access control on certain controller actions. Specifically, requests to load bucket metadata could be executed without requiring administrative privileges, potentially exposing internal configuration or other sensitive details to unauthorized users. The issue is fixed by enforcing administrator-only access checks on those endpoints, preventing unauthorized access and mitigating the information disclosure risk.",
