Since Redis 5 is a wrapper around `RedisClient`, the middleware-based instrumentation designed for `RedisClient` also applies to Redis 5. As a result, when using Redis 5, `AUTH` parameters are improperly recorded as span attributes at runtime, potentially leaking credentials and other sensitive data.",
