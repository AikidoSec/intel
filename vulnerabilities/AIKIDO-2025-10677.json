  "tldr": "Chromium ships with robotframework-browser and is thus a crucial part of its security posture. As robotframework-browser processes untrusted content and code, any issue in Chromium could potentially be exploited. Type confusion in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 140.0.7339.185 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: High).",
