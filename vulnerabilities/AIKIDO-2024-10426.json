  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This vulnerability occurs when an attacker injects a server-side script into the `src` attribute of a `<script>` tag. Due to the usage of `child_process.execFileSync()` in happy-dom to perform synchronous fetch operations, an attacker can escape from the URL string, injecting arbitrary code. For example, an attacker could exploit this by using a payload like:`document.write(`<script src=\"https://localhost:8080/'+require('child_process').execSync('id')+'\"></script>`);`\nThis would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially compromising the system.",
