  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication Bypass due to an improper access control configuration in the WebUI, where the primary `/chat/` endpoint was not protected by the authentication mechanism, while sub-paths like `/chat/test` correctly enforced password checks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directly navigating to the main chat endpoint to gain unauthorized access to the application's interface and functionality without requiring a password.",
