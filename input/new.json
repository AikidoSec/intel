  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution due to unsafe YAML deserialization. They use `yaml.load()` with `loader=yaml.FullLoader` to process untrusted YAML input. An attacker can exploit this by supplying a maliciously crafted YAML file containing embedded Python commands, which are executed during deserialization and can potentially lead to full system compromise.",
