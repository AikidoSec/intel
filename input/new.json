  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SVG parsing XSS, where image loader insecurely processes SVG content, failing to sanitize non-SVG elements like `<link>` or `<img>` during parsing. It allows attackers to craft malicious SVG images containing embedded scripts or external resource tags that execute when loaded via Babylon.js `GUI.Image` component. Exploitation occurs when a vulnerable application (without proper Content Security Policies) renders user-supplied SVG files, enabling cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that hijack user sessions, steal data, or perform malicious actions within the application context.",
