  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package allow a permissions bypass in the Node.js Permissions model, where crafted relative symlink paths can circumvent `--allow-fs-read` and `--allow-fs-write` restrictions. By chaining directories and symlinks, a script limited to the current directory can escape the permitted path and perform arbitrary file read or write operations, breaking isolation guarantees and potentially leading to system compromise.",
