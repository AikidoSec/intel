  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to file inclusion due to insufficient validation of file paths used by secure data sources. The control plane allows reading data from filesystem paths without properly restricting traversal sequences or enforcing absolute paths, allowing an attacker with configuration control to reference unintended files on the host system. This could result in unauthorized access to sensitive local files. The issue is fixed by validating file paths, rejecting directory traversal sequences, and requiring absolute paths before reading files.",
