  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure through the `buildkite-agent oidc request-token` command due to the lack of automatic redaction for OIDC tokens in build logs. Unlike the `secret get` command, which automatically masks sensitive values, the OIDC token command outputs the raw, sensitive token in plaintext. An attacker with access to build logs (e.g., through a compromised account or misconfigured log storage) could harvest these exposed tokens, which may then be used to impersonate the build identity and gain unauthorized access to dependent services and resources.",
