  "tldr": "A crafted HEIF file that exercises the overlay image item path triggers a heap buffer over-read in `HeifPixelImage::overlay()`. The function calculates a negative row length—likely due to an unclipped overlay rectangle or invalid offsets—which underflows when converted to `size_t` and is then passed to `memcpy`. This results in an excessively large read beyond the bounds of the source plane, leading to a crash.",
