  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the `split(/s*,s*/)` operation on untrusted ETag headers. The vulnerable regular expression, which matches any number of whitespace characters around commas, can be exploited by an attacker sending a specially crafted, excessively long string of whitespace and commas in the `ETag` header. This can cause catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine, consuming massive amounts of CPU and resulting in a complete denial of service.",
