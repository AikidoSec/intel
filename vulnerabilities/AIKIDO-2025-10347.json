  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write due to insufficient validation of the `nSelectors` value parsed from untrusted input. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious BZip2 file with excessively large nSelectors, causing the loop to write beyond the bounds of the `selectorMtf` array, potentially leading to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution depending on runtime conditions.",
