  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Expression Execution via the Internal Expression Evaluation Endpoint, where the internal HTTP server's `/expr` endpoint, which compiles and executes user-supplied Go expressions from the `code` parameter, can be exploited if the server is inadvertently exposed or if the low-entropy default authentication secret (`by-dev`) is guessed or leaked, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary logic within the server's context, such as calling exposed functions like `param.Get()` or `param.Save()` to read or manipulate configuration, leading to information disclosure, system compromise, or denial-of-service.",
