  "tldr": "Affected versions of `ruzstd` miscalculate the length of the allocated and initialized section of its internal `RingBuffer`, leading to uninitialized or out-of-bounds reads in the `copy_bytes_overshooting` function. This vulnerability allows up to 15 bytes of uninitialized memory to be read and potentially written into the output when decompressing a specially crafted archive. If exploited, this issue may result in sensitive memory contents being included in the decompressed data. This leakage can occur multiple times during the processing of a single archive, increasing the potential exposure of confidential information.",
