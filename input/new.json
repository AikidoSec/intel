  "tldr": "Affected versions of Python starting from `3.12.0` introduce a memory exhaustion risk in `asyncio._SelectorSocketTransport.writelines()`. The method does not properly pause writing or signal the Protocol to drain the buffer once the write buffer reaches the high-water mark. As a result, Protocols may fail to periodically drain the write buffer, leading to uncontrolled memory growth.",
  "doest_this_affect_me": "You are affected if you are using a vulnerable version of `python` on macOS or Linux and rely on the `asyncio` module with protocols while using the `.writelines()` method. This vulnerability likely impacts a limited number of users, as it specifically requires the use of `.writelines()`, which introduced a new zero-copy-on-write behavior in Python 3.12.0. If any of these conditions do not apply to your setup, your usage of Python remains unaffected.",
