  "tldr": "This vulnerability in Chromium's Mojo inter-process communication (IPC) system could allow an untrusted process to leak handles by reflecting a broker-initiated transport back to the broker. If an attacker-controlled (untrusted) node receives a transport from a broker (a privileged process managing handle sharing), it could maliciously reflect it back. When the broker later deserializes another transport containing handles using the reflected transport, handle leaks occurâ€”potentially exposing sensitive resources or enabling privilege escalation.",
