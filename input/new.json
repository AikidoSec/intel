  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to cross-site scripting due to insufficient sanitization of attachment payloads in the Trix editor prior to version 2.1.16. An attacker can inject malicious content into the `data-trix-attachment` attribute, which, when rendered as HTML and interacted with, allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the user’s session, potentially resulting in unauthorized actions or disclosure of sensitive information.",
