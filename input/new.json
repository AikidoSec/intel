  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to its default JavaScript engine configuration in gray-matter. This configuration allows arbitrary JavaScript code execution during front matter parsing, as unsanitized input is processed without proper restrictions. An attacker can exploit this by creating a malicious file with embedded JavaScript in the front matter. If gray-matter parses this file with the JavaScript engine enabled, the code executes in the server context, compromising security.",
