  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package have multiple robustness issues in the ICMP handling code, including insufficient validation of packet headers and unsafe assumptions about buffer and payload sizes that could lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or denial of service. The patched version hardens ICMP echo path validation, fixes potential overflows and undefined behavior, and improves safety checks to prevent these issues.",
