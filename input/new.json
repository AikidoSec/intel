  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Password Reset/Email Verification Pages due to improper neutralization of user-controlled input in the `token`, `username`, and `locale` parameters of the HTML pages used for these functions. An attacker could exploit this by tricking a victim into clicking a specially crafted link containing a malicious script, which would then execute in the victim's browser when they visit the password reset or email verification page, potentially allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the victim.",
