  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to authentication bypass due to an improper authorization check. The original code incorrectly set `authRequired` to false when `ctx.body.userId` was present, allowing API requests to potentially skip session validation by providing a user ID in the request body. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting requests with a malicious `userId` payload, thereby bypassing session checks and potentially gaining unauthorized access to other user accounts or performing privileged actions.",
