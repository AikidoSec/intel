  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) due to improper handling of element ID templates in condition rules. Untrusted input was rendered without proper sandboxing, allowing crafted templates to execute arbitrary code in certain contexts. The issue is fixed by using a sandboxed template rendering mechanism to prevent unsafe code execution.",
