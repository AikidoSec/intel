  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package allow loading of malicious `.keras` files containing crafted HDF5 metadata with extreme or overflowing tensor shapes, leading to unbounded memory allocation and potential remote denial of service. An attacker could exploit this by supplying a shape bomb that triggers recursive path handling issues or forces NumPy to allocate multi-gigabyte tensors during model loading, exhausting memory or crashing the process before validation occurs.",
