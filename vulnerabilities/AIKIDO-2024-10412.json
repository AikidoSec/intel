  "tldr" : "A vulnerability has been identified in the Express `response.links` function, allowing arbitrary resource injection into the `Link` header when unsanitized data is used. The issue arises from improper sanitization of `Link` header values, which allows characters like `,`, `;`, and `<>` to preload malicious resources. This vulnerability is particularly concerning when dynamic parameters are involved.",
