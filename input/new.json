  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are affected by Path Traversal due to an insecure join method that fails to ensure that the root path is safe using `filepath.Clean`. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to exploit the root path by tricking the function into resolving a path outside the intended directory structure. As a result, this opens the door to directory traversal attacks, enabling the attacker to access or manipulate files in unauthorized locations if the caller does not validate the root path.",
