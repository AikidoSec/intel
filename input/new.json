  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the GenAI Client evaluation visualization component due to unsanitized embedding of user-controlled JSON data into HTML. The old code directly injected eval_result_json into a JavaScript variable without encoding, allowing attackers to craft malicious JSON containing script payloads. An attacker could exploit this by submitting manipulated evaluation data that, when viewed in the report, executes arbitrary code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or further attacks. The patch mitigates this by base64-encoding the JSON and decoding it safely in JavaScript, thereby preventing direct script injection.",
