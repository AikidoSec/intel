This can lead to excessive backtracking in regular expressions, making the application vulnerable to Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). Attackers can exploit this by sending specially crafted inputs that trigger high computational overhead, potentially causing severe performance degradation, system outages, or denial of service.",
