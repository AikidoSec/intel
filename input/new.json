  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via a command injection vulnerability in the APNS certificate P12 decoder, where a maliciously crafted P12 filename could be executed as shell code due to unsafe passing of user-provided strings to `execSync`. The fix replaced `execSync` with `spawnSync` to ensure strings are always treated as parameters, not executable code, and added validation to confirm the PEM file exists before access. An attacker could exploit this by providing a specially crafted filename containing shell metacharacters or commands, which would be executed in the context of the application's process when the decoder was invoked.",
