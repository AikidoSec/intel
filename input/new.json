  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to authentication bypass through double-URL encoded paths. An attacker could use multi-level URL encoding (e.g. `/%2561dmin`) to access routes that should be behind authentication. The patch fixes this by decoding pathnames and rejecting requests that contain leftover percent-encoded sequences after decoding.",
