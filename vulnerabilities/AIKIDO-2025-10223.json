  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a thread safety issue in the `proxy` option of Faraday, where the provided hash is mutated by adding keys to it. In multi-threaded environments, this can lead to a `RuntimeError`. The fix avoids modifying the original hash by working with a duplicate instead and includes a test to ensure the original `proxy` option remains unchanged.",
