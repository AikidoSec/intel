  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper URL validation in the URL sanitization function. The function only checks for URLs starting with `http://`, `https://`, or `www.`, returning them unmodified or prepending `https://` to `www.` inputs, while returning `undefined` for all other cases. Suppose the calling code falls back to the original unsanitized input when `undefined` is returned. In that case, an attacker can exploit this by supplying a malicious `javascript:` URL (e.g., `javascript:alert(document.cookie)`), which executes arbitrary code in the victim's browser when triggered.",
