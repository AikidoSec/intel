  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to DOM Clobbering due to insufficient validation of script tags in the URL resolution logic. The `getImportMetaUrl` function insecurely relies on `document.currentScript` and `document.baseURI` without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious HTML elements that override these properties. An attacker could exploit this by clobbering `document.currentScript.src` or `document.baseURI` with controlled values, potentially redirecting script imports to arbitrary malicious URLs and enabling cross-site scripting (XSS) or code execution.",
