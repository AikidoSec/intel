  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to the unsafe use of `eval()` for parsing user-supplied values. This has been fixed by replacing `eval()` with `ast.literal_eval()` throughout the codebase, ensuring safe and predictable parsing of configuration inputs. The update prevents code injection risks, improves input handling in functions like `smart_value()`, and enhances overall security and reliability.",
