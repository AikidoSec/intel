  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to improper serialization of token headers due to allowing unprotected headers to overwrite integrity-protected headers. An attacker with access to the JWS JSON object can exploit this by injecting malicious values into unprotected headers (e.g., modifying `key` to point to a malicious key, or altering `exp` to extend token validity), bypassing signature validation for critical parameters and potentially leading to authentication bypass or privilege escalation.",
