  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to arbitrary file creation due to improper handling of the version parameter in HTTP requests for CSS/JS bundles. By manipulating this parameter, an attacker can control the server-side cache directory, enabling username enumeration by testing for folder existence in paths like `C:Users` and depleting disk space by forcing the server to create a unique cache file for each request. These attacks can be performed by unauthenticated users, potentially leading to information disclosure or denial of service by filling the server's storage.",
