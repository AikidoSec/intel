  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to arbitrary JavaScript execution due to the `getProperty` method's arguments not being sanitized before handling it in a `new Function()` call. It allows an attacker to craft a malicious payload to break out of the intended property lookup and inject executable code. Since `new Function()` evaluates the generated string as live JavaScript, this vulnerability can result in Remote Code Execution (RCE) in environments where input controlled by an attacker reaches this method.",
