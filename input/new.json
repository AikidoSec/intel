  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection due to insecure XML deserialization in the `Deserialize` function, which uses `XmlSerializer` without disabling external entity processing. It allows the parser to resolve external entities when processing untrusted XML input. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious XML payload that includes references to external entities, leading to unauthorized file access, server-side request forgery, or denial of service attacks by exhausting system resources.",
