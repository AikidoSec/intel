  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to command/argument injection in the Git helper: user-controlled repository URLs could be interpreted as command-line options (e.g., starting with `-`), allowing an attacker to alter the behavior of `git ls-remote`, `git remote add`, or `git clone` and potentially exfiltrate data or tamper with the local repo. The fix inserts the `--` end-of-options separator before URL arguments in these invocations so URLs are always treated as positional arguments.",
