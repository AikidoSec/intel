  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package load models using `torch.load()` without setting the `weights_only` parameter to `True`, thereby enabling full pickle deserialization. Since pickle is inherently insecure, this allows the execution of arbitrary code during model loading. A remote attacker could exploit this behavior by crafting malicious pickle data, potentially leading to serious vulnerabilities such as remote code execution (RCE).",
