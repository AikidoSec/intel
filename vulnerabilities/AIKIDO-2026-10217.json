  "tldr": "Affected versions of `markdown-it` contained a performance regression in the `linkify` inline rule that could be triggered by certain malformed or pathological input patterns, leading to excessive CPU use and an effective denial-of-service condition. The issue was fixed by replacing a costly regular expression with a manual back-search approach in the `linkify-it` wrapper to avoid inefficient pattern matching and restore predictable performance.",
