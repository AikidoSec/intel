  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure by caching all executed commands in shell history, including those containing confidential data (e.g., `s3_secret_access_key=...`). Attackers can exploit this by accessing the shell history file (e.g., `~/.bash_history`) through compromised user accounts, privilege escalation, or insecure file permissions. Once retrieved, exposed secrets enable unauthorized access to protected systems, data theft, or lateral movement within environments.",
