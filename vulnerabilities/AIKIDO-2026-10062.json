  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an SSZ deserialization flaw in the `Option<T>` type due to improper validation of trailing bytes. When decoding an `Option<T>` with the 'None' selector (0x00), the implementation correctly returns `None` but fails to enforce that the remaining payload must be zero-length. It allows arbitrary extra 'dirty' bytes to be present and ignored during deserialization. An attacker could craft multiple different byte sequences that all decode to the same logical `None` value, leading to critical hash mismatches where two semantically identical objects have different Merkle tree roots, potentially disrupting network consensus and causing chain splits.",
