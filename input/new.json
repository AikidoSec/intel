  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks due to stack overflow vulnerabilities in both the edge chain parser and HTML string parser. Maliciously crafted DOT files with deeply nested edge chains or HTML-like structures could trigger excessive recursion, leading to application crashes or memory exhaustion. The fix introduces configurable depth limits (`maxEdgeChainDepth` and `maxHtmlNestingDepth`) to restrict parsing depth and prevent stack overflow while maintaining backward compatibility for normal use cases.",
