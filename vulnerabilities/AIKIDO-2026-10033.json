  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package allow a permissions bypass in the Node.js permission model, where Unix Domain Socket (UDS) connections are not properly restricted when `--permission` is enabled. Even without `--allow-net`, attacker-controlled inputs such as URLs or `socketPath` options can be used with `net`, `tls`, or `undici`/`fetch` to connect to arbitrary local sockets. This breaks the intended security boundary, enabling unauthorized access to privileged local services and potentially leading to privilege escalation, data exposure, or local code execution.",
