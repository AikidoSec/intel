  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to returning the wrong status code. `salt-call` does not fail when it encounters bad pillar data. If the master returns invalid pillar data, `salt-call` uses a default value from the state instead of failing. This may result in invalid states being applied or a loss of pillar integrity.",
