  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to improper input validation. Users can specify the `api_base` parameter when making requests to `POST /chat/completions`. The application then sends the request to the domain specified by `api_base`, which includes the OpenAI API key. A malicious user can set `api_base` to their own domain and invoke `POST /chat/completions` to intercept and steal the OpenAI API key.",
