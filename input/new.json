  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package expose the root directory path in the browser window title, allowing attackers to infer sensitive server structures. By observing customized directory names, such as `/JohnDoeHome` (in the window title), unauthenticated or low-privileged users can map user accounts, internal naming conventions, or project hierarchies. This type of information facilitates targeted attacks such as path traversal exploits by revealing restricted directory names.",
