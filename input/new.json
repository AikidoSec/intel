  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are affected by unsafe deserialization due to the use of `torch.load` with the `weights_only` parameter set to its default value of False. This function uses pickle for deserialization, which is insecure when handling untrusted data. This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution if a malicious model is loaded. An attacker could exploit this by uploading a harmful model file, affecting unsuspecting users of vLLM.",
