  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a chain of interrelated security issues, beginning with a critical cross-tenant static asset vulnerability where assets uploaded by one customer were accessible from another's domain, enabling cross-domain XSS via malicious files like SVGs. Furthermore, a path traversal bypass using URL-encoded characters was discovered, which circumvented the initial fix for the asset vulnerability. Additionally, several cross-domain data endpoints (/_mintlify/markdown/, RSS, favicon, MCP) allowed unauthorized data access across subdomains, while a server-side rendering code execution flaw permitted injection of malicious MDX code. Moreover, a downgrade attack allowed access to older, potentially vulnerable site versions, and an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the dashboard exposed details of other customers' documentation history.",
