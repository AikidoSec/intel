  "tldr": "`CVE-2025-10492` is a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability in JasperReports Library. The JRLoader class can deserialize attacker-controlled objects, which allows arbitrary code execution if a malicious serialized payload is processed. You are safe when your application only uses trusted, prepackaged report templates or when you run a recent commercial/enterprise edition, as those versions include vendor-provided patches. You are also safe when JasperReports runs on `Java 17` or later, because modern Java versions block deserialization of arbitrary classes by default, preventing the malicious gadget chain.",
  "doest_this_affect_me": "You are affected when your application loads report templates (`.jrxml` or `.jasper`) from untrusted or user-supplied sources, or when external input can influence what JasperReports deserializes — for example through upload features, dynamic template loading, or accepting serialized report data.",
  "how_to_fix": "Mitigation consists of strictly using trusted templates, disabling user uploads or external template loading, segmenting the reporting component on the network, and ensuring that no untrusted serialized data reaches JRLoader.",
