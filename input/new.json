  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to directory traversal (Zip-Slip) attacks during extraction of archives, where crafted entries with symlinks or paths pointing outside the intended extraction directory could cause files to be written to unexpected locations; this patch enhances path validation by adding stricter checks (including symlink resolution) via `is_path_valid` and rejects invalid extraction paths, mitigating the Zip-Slip risk.",
