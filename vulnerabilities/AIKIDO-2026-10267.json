  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package contain an out-of-bounds read in Digest authentication due to the use of `memcmp()` with a fixed length to compare the `algorithm` field, which could read past the intended buffer if the input is shorter or improperly terminated. An attacker controlling or influencing the `algorithm` value (e.g., via a malicious server response or crafted authentication header) could trigger memory disclosure or application instability by causing unintended memory access. The patch replaces `memcmp()` with `strcasecmp()` to ensure safe, null-terminated string comparison and prevent buffer over-reads.",
