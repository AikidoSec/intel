  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package return an incorrect status code. When a refresh token has expired, been revoked, cannot be decrypted, or does not belong to the correct client. In the patch version, the server correctly issues an `invalid_grant` error with a HTTP 400 response but in previous versions, the server incorrectly issued an `invalid_request` error and a HTTP 401 response. This issue has been resolved to ensure the correct handling of token-related errors and improve error reporting consistency.",
