  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are affected by Code Injection due to a bypass in Jinja's sandbox validation that restricts direct calls to `str.format` possible by storing a reference to the format method of a malicious string and invoking it indirectly through a filter. This flaw allows an attacker to manipulate a template's content to execute arbitrary code.",
