  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package allow insecure URL rewrite handling where `url_key` validation was overly permissive and SQL queries were built via string interpolation, enabling malicious input to influence database operations. An attacker could craft specially formatted `url_key` values (including unexpected characters or long strings) to manipulate `request_path` replacements and, in the worst case, perform SQL injection during update or delete flows. By injecting controlled values into `currentPath.request_path` or `path`, an attacker could corrupt URL mappings, overwrite routes of other entities, or disrupt application routing integrity. The fix enforces strict URL key constraints and uses parameterized queries to eliminate injection vectors.",
