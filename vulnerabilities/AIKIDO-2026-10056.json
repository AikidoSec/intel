  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to regular expression injection due to the use of a user-controlled directory value when dynamically constructing a `RegExp` without proper escaping. By embedding the raw `dirToFlatten` value directly into a regular expression, an attacker can inject arbitrary regex fragments and influence matching behavior. Properly escaping all regex metacharacters before building `dirToFlattenRegex` preserves the intended semantics while preventing regex injection.",
