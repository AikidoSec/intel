  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) and prompt injection via chat history manipulation due to unsafe use of `eval()` and improper input sanitization. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious tool call to execute arbitrary Python code through eval or injecting fake chat history entries to manipulate AI behavior. The fix replaces eval with ast.literal_eval and validates chat history entries to prevent unauthorized modifications.",
