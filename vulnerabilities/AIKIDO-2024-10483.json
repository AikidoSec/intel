  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package use a vulnerable version of the `Newtonsoft.Json` library, specifically versions prior to 13.0.1. These versions are impacted by <a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5crp-9r3c-p9vr\">CVE-2024-21907</a>, which stems from insecure defaults in handling deeply nested expressions. This can lead to a `StackOverflowException` or excessive CPU and memory consumption, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing input with high nesting levels, overwhelming system resources and causing the application to crash or become unresponsive. However, the risk can be mitigated by manually configuring the `MaxDepth` property in `JsonSerializerSettings` to limit the depth of nested objects during serialization, which is done for `Hangfire.Core` in the patch version.",
