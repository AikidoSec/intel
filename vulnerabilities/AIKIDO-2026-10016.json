  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package contain a vulnerability where sensitive authentication tokens are recorded in plaintext within TRACE-level application logs due to insufficient output sanitization in the gateway request handler; specifically, when the `messagesSent` counter is below a threshold, the full message containing the token is written to log files via `LOG.trace('<- {}', message)`, allowing an attacker with access to these logs (e.g., through compromised systems, internal threats, or misconfigured log storage) to harvest tokens and impersonate users or escalate privileges.",
