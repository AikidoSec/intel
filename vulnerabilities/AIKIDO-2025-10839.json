  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a panic in the `HeaderMap::try_reserve` method due to an integer overflow in the `to_raw_capacity` helper function, which violates Rust's convention that `try_*` methods should never panic. It occurs when calculating the raw capacity for a header map, where a sufficiently large input causes a panic instead of returning a `MaxSizeReached` error. An attacker can exploit this by providing crafted input that triggers the overflow panic, leading to a denial of service by crashing the application.",
