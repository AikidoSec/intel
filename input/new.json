  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to improper password verification in `BCryptPasswordEncoder.matches(CharSequence, String)`. When a password exceeds 72 characters, only the first 72 characters are considered for comparison. As a result, passwords that share the same initial 72 characters will incorrectly be treated as identical, potentially allowing authentication bypass.",
