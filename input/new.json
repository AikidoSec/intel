  "tldr": "Affected versions are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read that can leak heap memory contents. By setting `XML_OPTION_SKIP_TAGSTART` to a sufficiently high value and providing XML with shorter tag names than expected, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability. While the affected option is rarely used, it still poses a security risk.",
