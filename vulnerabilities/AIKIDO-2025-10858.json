  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) due to insufficient parsing limits for large lists of tuples in SQL statements, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious, overly complex SQL statement with deeply nested tuples to cause excessive CPU consumption and service unavailability, which is mitigated by the introduction of configurable limits on grouping depth and tokens (`MAX_GROUPING_DEPTH=100`, `MAX_GROUPING_TOKENS=10000`).",
