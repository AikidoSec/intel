  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package allowed the `set_base_url` remote command to accept arbitrary URL schemes without proper validation, enabling unsafe protocol handling. An attacker could supply a crafted URL using non-HTTP(S) schemes (e.g., `file://`, `ftp://`, or custom handlers) to coerce the application into accessing local resources, internal services, or unexpected endpoints. This may lead to local file disclosure, SSRF-like behavior, or abuse of protocol handlers depending on how the base URL is consumed. The issue is mitigated by restricting accepted schemes to `http://` and `https://` only.",
