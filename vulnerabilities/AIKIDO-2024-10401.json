  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The OAuth2 Adapter fails to enforce the presence of the state parameter, even when `supportRequestState` is enabled. This allows an attacker to intercept the returning request containing the `code` and `state` URL parameters, strip the `state` parameter, and provide it to a different user with a different browser. As a result, the authorization process is completed without validating the original state, enabling potential CSRF attacks.",
