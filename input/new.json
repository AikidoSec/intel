  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package may expose sensitive information due to the use of `<root-path path=\".\" />` in `share_download_paths.xml`. This configuration grants access to the appâ€™s entire internal storage directory, potentially exposing files and subdirectories that were intended to remain private. As a result, other apps or users may gain unauthorized access to sensitive data such as configuration files, cached content, or authentication tokens. This constitutes a violation of access boundaries, exposing internal resources to a broader and unintended audience.",
