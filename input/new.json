  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to brute force attacks due to insufficient protection against repeated SMS verification attempts. The patched version introduces comprehensive safeguards, including `MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS` (default: 5) to limit failed verification attempts before session lockout, `MIN_TOKEN_LENGTH` (default: 6) to enforce a minimum security code length, and a new `failed_attempts` field in the `SMSVerification` model with a migration for backward compatibility. These enhancements prevent automated attacks and improve the overall security of the verification process.",
