  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to unsanitized href attributes. This vulnerability arises when user-controlled input is assigned directly to the href property of anchor tags without proper sanitization. An attacker can exploit this by injecting malicious JavaScript URLs (for example, `javascript:alert('XSS')`) into the href field. If unsuspecting users click on the manipulated link, the arbitrary script executes in their browser context, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious actions.",
