  "tldr" : "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to eval injection in the `BingBertSquad` test script. This occurs because the script does not properly sanitize user input before passing it to the `eval()` function. As a result, an attacker can execute arbitrary code by injecting malicious input. This vulnerability allows attackers to take control of the application, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or further exploitation of the underlying system.",
