  "tldr": "Affected versions of Spring Framework (6.0.x â‰¤ 6.0.5, 6.1.x, and 6.2.x) are vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack when `Content-Disposition` headers are constructed using `ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String, Charset)` with unsanitized user input and a non-ASCII charset. The vulnerability allows attackers to craft a response with a malicious filename and injected content that could be executed when downloaded.",
  "doest_this_affect_me": "You are affected if you are using a version which is within vulnerability ranges. Applications are not vulnerable if the header is not set, not built with `ContentDisposition`, uses ASCII-only filename methods, sanitizes input, or does not allow content injection.",
