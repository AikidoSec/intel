  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the `ROUTE_DYNAMIC_SPLIT` regex pattern (`/[(.+?(.+?)|.+?)]/`), which exhibits super-linear time complexity due to nested lazy quantifiers and ambiguous matching paths; an attacker can exploit this by supplying a specially crafted string (e.g., a long sequence of characters followed by mismatched brackets) that forces the regex engine to process an exponential number of backtracking paths, ultimately consuming excessive CPU resources and stalling the application.",
