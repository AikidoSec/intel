  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to improper authorization: the `AuthenticationProcessInterceptor` sets the caller’s authentication in the shared `SecurityContext` but does not reliably clear it afterward, causing authentication information to leak across requests when threads are reused. As a result, a subsequent request may inherit a previous user’s identity and unintentionally pass `@PreAuthorize` checks.",
