  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a bit overflow when writing headers. In these functions, the call to `bw.write(5, 31)` e.g. attempts to write the signed integer `31` using only 5 bits, which is insufficient due to the sign bit requirement. This can result in incorrect header encoding and potentially unpredictable behavior.",
