  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a Use After Free issue in the `didCompleteRequestWithResponse:error:` method, where `response.MIMEType` is accessed from a deallocated `NSURLResponse` object. This can cause an `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` crash under certain network or SDK conditions due to premature deallocation and thread-safety issues. The fix ensures the MIME type is safely copied before use to prevent accessing freed memory.",
