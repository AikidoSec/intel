  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to inadequate escaping of the `Blog Name` field. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting a crafted payload into the `Blog Name`, which is then rendered in the application without proper sanitization. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.",
