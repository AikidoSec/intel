  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption. When multiple concurrent calls are made to `ZipUtil.zip(fileb, filea.listFiles())` and `fileb` is also in the `filea` directory, the zip function will traverse the file and add its own file to it, resulting in a self-loop. This causes the `fileb` file to continue growing.",
