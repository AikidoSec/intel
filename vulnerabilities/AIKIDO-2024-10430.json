In sandbox mode, an attacker could exploit a vulnerability that allows calling the `toString()` method on an object, even if the `__toString()` method is restricted by the security policy. This issue could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or allow the execution of malicious code, depending on what the `toString()` method reveals about the object or its internal state.",
