  "tldr": "Several patches were applied to `jsonpath-plus` to prevent untrusted JavaScript execution when evaluating a path with the default `eval='safe'` mode. While version 10.2.0 was initially considered secure, a newly crafted payload has been discovered that still allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in safe mode. This enables remote code execution (RCE) in server-side contexts where `JSONPath()` is called with a user-controlled path. In client-side contexts, this can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) if user input is used to construct the path.",
