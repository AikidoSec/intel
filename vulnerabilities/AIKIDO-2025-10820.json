  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Memory Limit Enforcement on zstd Encoded Requests, where the `maxDataSize` memory limits are not correctly applied to zstd compressed requests, undermining the protection for ingest endpoints against malicious payloads. An attacker could exploit this by sending a specially crafted zstd encoded request that exceeds memory constraints, potentially leading to resource exhaustion, denial of service, or unauthorized system access.",
