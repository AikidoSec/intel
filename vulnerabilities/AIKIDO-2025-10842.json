  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to arbitrary code execution because they call `unserialize()` on user-supplied files without restricting which classes may be instantiated. This allows attackers to perform PHP object injection and potentially trigger malicious gadget chains. The issue is fixed by invoking `unserialize()` with `allowed_classes => false`, which prevents custom objects from being created while still allowing arrays and `stdClass` values. This preserves backward compatibility with existing serialized array files while effectively blocking RCE via unsafe object deserialization.",
