  "tldr": "Affected versions are vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling when using the `gevent_wsgi` or `gevent_pywsgi` worker classes. The issue stems from gevent’s `PyWSGIHandler`, where the `EXPECT: 100-continue` header causes the server to retain extra bytes in the socket buffer. These bytes are then interpreted as a new HTTP request, even if forwarded as part of an earlier one. This allows attackers to smuggle unauthorized requests—such as accessing `/admin` while only `/api` is exposed via a reverse proxy. The vulnerability can lead to serious security issues such as cache poisoning, data exposure, session hijacking, SSRF, cross-site scripting, and other impacts typical of HTTP request smuggling attacks.",
