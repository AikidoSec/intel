  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package contain non-reentrant functions that call other non-reentrant functions, leading to race conditions, memory corruption, or undefined behavior when executed in interruptible or concurrent contexts. An attacker could exploit this by forcing re-entry, such as sending a malicious signal while the target function is executing, or by triggering concurrent execution in multi-threaded applications, potentially causing crashes, privilege escalation, or arbitrary code execution due to a corrupted global state.",
