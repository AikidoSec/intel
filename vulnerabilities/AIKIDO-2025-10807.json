  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an authorization bypass. The `Request` class improperly handles certain `PATH_INFO` values, allowing URLs to be represented without a leading `/`. This behavior can bypass access control mechanisms that rely on the assumption that all paths begin with a `/`.",
