  "tldr": "Affected versions of the `next-intl` library are vulnerable to open redirect. The library accepts user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site and uses it in a redirect, facilitating phishing attacks. The vulnerability occurs because `decodeURI` does not escape decoded backslashes (`%5C` & `%5c`), leading to unsafe external pathnames in the middleware functionality.",
