  "tldr" : "The latest version of `@intlify/shared` is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution through the `lib.deepCopy` function. An attacker can craft a payload that modifies the global prototype chain by adding or altering properties, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) as a minimum impact. If the polluted properties affect sensitive areas of the application, such as Node.js APIs (`exec`, `eval`), the vulnerability can escalate to arbitrary command execution, posing a severe security risk.",
