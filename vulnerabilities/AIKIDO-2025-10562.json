  "tldr": "Affected versions of Spring Framework MVC are vulnerable to path traversal when deployed on non-compliant Servlet containers. The issue arises if the application is deployed as a WAR or with an embedded container, the container does not properly reject suspicious path sequences, and the application serves static resources using Springâ€™s resource handling. While deployments on Apache Tomcat or Eclipse Jetty with default security features enabled are not affected, other containers or configurations may be exploitable, so upgrading to a patched version is strongly recommended.",
