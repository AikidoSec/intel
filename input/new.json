  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package could be vulnerable to SQL injection when PostgreSQL’s `standard_conforming_strings` is explicitly set to `off`, a legacy configuration that modern deployments rarely use. Because this setting has defaulted to `on` for over a decade, the practical impact is minimal. The fix enforces `standard_conforming_strings=on` and `client_encoding=UTF8` to ensure safe string-literal handling, though testing these conditions is difficult without legacy or deliberately misconfigured PostgreSQL instances.",
