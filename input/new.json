  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package disable Session Replay by default on iOS 26.0+ when built with Xcode 26.0 or later to prevent potential PII (Personally identifiable information) leaks. This mitigation addresses masking issues introduced by Appleâ€™s new Liquid Glass rendering, which can expose sensitive user data during session recording. Developers can temporarily re-enable Session Replay using `options.experimental.enableSessionReplayInUnreliableEnvironment = true`, but doing so carries privacy risks.",
