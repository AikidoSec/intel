  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package may expose internal subscription state across multiple Redux store instances in SSR (Server-Side Rendering) environments due to a shared `InternalMiddlewareState` reference. This bug allows unintended data persistence or leakage of active subscription metadata between stores. The patch ensures that subscription data is correctly scoped per store using a `WeakMap<Dispatch, Thing>`, preventing cross-store data exposure and improving cleanup reliability.",
