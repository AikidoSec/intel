  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to cache poisoning due to the use of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm in the default cache key encoder. SHA-1 is not collision-resistant, allowing attackers to craft different inputs that produce the same hash. This may result in incorrect or malicious cache hits. While SHA-1 deprecation is underway, the transition is currently opt-in to preserve backward compatibility. This issue is especially relevant for applications exposed to untrusted input, requiring high cache integrity, or subject to security compliance.",
  "doest_this_affect_me": "You are affected if you are using a version that falls within the vulnerable range.",
  "how_to_fix": "Upgrade the `@langchain/core` library to the patch version or you can supply a stronger hash function (such as SHA-256 or SHA-3) for cache key encoding by using the `makeDefaultKeyEncoder()` method on your cache instance.",
