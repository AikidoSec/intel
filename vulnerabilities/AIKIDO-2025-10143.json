  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to improper authentication cookie handling because the `clear_auth_cookie` function does not explicitly specify the `secure` and `samesite` attributes when deleting authentication cookies. This can lead to failed logout attempts, especially if `CHAINLIT_COOKIE_SAMESITE` is set to a non-default value, as the browser may not clear the cookie correctly.",
