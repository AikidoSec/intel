  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are affected by a design flaw where it constructs a Request object using the incoming request's properties (method, headers, body) and builds a new URL from `req.protocol` and `req.hostname` (derived from untrusted headers like `X-Forwarded-Host` or `Host`). This request is forwarded to the tainted URL without proper validation, allowing forgery attacks like crafting a malicious site that sends forged state-changing requests, such as POST, using the victim's session cookies.",
