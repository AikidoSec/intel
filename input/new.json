  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to prototype pollution via the `applicationData` API, where unvalidated, user-controlled paths passed to `_.set()` and JSON Patch operations could include dangerous segments like `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`, allowing an attacker to manipulate the object prototype and potentially alter application behaviour or gain unauthorized access; the issue is fixed by adding validation to block such prototype pollution paths and returning a 400 response when they are detected, preventing exploitation.",
