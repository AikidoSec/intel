  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package do not support the `TrustedTypes API`, which is designed to prevent DOM-based injection attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). When used in environments enforcing TrustedTypes, Swiper.js fails to wrap dynamic HTML assignments with `innerHTML`. An attacker could exploit this by injecting malicious payloads into Swiper-controlled elements (e.g., slides, pagination, or navigation) if the application passes unsanitized user input to Swiper's initialization or content methods, effectively bypassing protections and enabling XSS attacks.",
