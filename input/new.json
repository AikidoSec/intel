  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the `reschedule/cancel-schedule` modal and `multilevel popup menu`, where the modal unsafely sets `innerHTML` using user-controlled input, and the popup menu directly inserts label and sublabel values into templates without sanitization. An attacker can exploit this by injecting malicious scripts into these inputs, which execute when the modal or menu is rendered, potentially stealing sensitive information, hijacking user sessions, or performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.",
