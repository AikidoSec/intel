  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package do not correctly enforce RFC 2183/7578 rules for quoted parameters, so a closing quote in a filename parameter does not terminate parsing as it should.  In practice an attacker can supply a header like `Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"payload.jpg\".html` and the library will incorrectly yield the filename `payload.jpg.html` instead of `payload.jpg`.  This bug was fixed in version 3.2.0 by changing the parser to skip any characters after the closing quote until the next semicolon.  In other words, the vulnerable versions will “continue to parse characters after” the closing quote, violating the spec. A malicious client could sneak a forbidden extension (like `.php` or `.html`) outside the quotes so that an upload filter is fooled or a file is saved with the wrong extension. This could lead to serving a malicious script or enabling XSS if a script file is stored under an allowed name.",
