  "tldr": "The patched version adds a strict option to detect potential ReDoS issues. A bad regular expression is generated whenever two parameters within a single segment are separated by something other than a period (`.`). For example, `/:a-:b`.",

  "how_to_fix": "Upgrade the `path-to-regexp` library to the patched version. For patch version 7.1.0, use the `'strict: true'` option. Older patch versions add backtrack protection but do not protect against vulnerable user-supplied capture groups. It is advised to upgrade to version 8.0.0, which removes the vulnerable feature entirely.",
