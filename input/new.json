  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package improperly sanitize multipart form field names, allowing specially crafted keys (e.g., `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`) to modify object prototypes during form parsing, leading to prototype pollution. An attacker can exploit this by submitting a malicious multipart request with crafted field names that inject properties into `Object.prototype`, potentially altering application logic, bypassing security controls, or causing denial of service depending on how polluted objects are used.",
