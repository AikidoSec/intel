  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to external control of file name or path through the `getBaseURL` function: an attacker who sends a crafted first request containing manipulated `x-forwarded-host` and `x-forwarded-proto` headers can poison the router’s `basePath`, causing all subsequent routes to return 404 errors for all users. This is only exploitable when `baseURL` is not explicitly configured and the attacker is able to make the very first request to the server after startup.",
