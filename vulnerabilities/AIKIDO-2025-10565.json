  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to observable timing discrepancies in signature validation. The `utils.web_app` module compares the calculated HMAC with the provided hash using `==`, which can inadvertently leak timing information and expose the application to timing attacks. While verification still functions correctly, the non-constant-time comparison creates a side channel risk. The patch replaces `==` with `hmac.compare_digest`, ensuring constant-time comparison and mitigating potential timing-based exploits.",
