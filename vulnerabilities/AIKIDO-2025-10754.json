  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack due to an API behavior change in OpenSSL 3.0, where the `EVP_PKEY_get0()` function can now return NULL, a case that was not possible in OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and earlier. If an application does not implement a NULL check after this function call, an attacker could potentially provide a malformed or invalid key, causing the application to dereference a NULL pointer and crash.",
