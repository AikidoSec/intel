  "tldr": "Apache Tomcat contains an unchecked error condition vulnerability in certain Jakarta Authentication (formerly JASPIC) configurations. If Tomcat uses a custom `ServerAuthContext` implementation that throws an exception during authentication without explicitly setting an HTTP error status, the authentication process may not fail as intended. As a result, a user could potentially bypass authentication. No known Jakarta Authentication components are currently known to exhibit this behavior.",
