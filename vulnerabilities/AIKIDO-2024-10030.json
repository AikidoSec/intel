  "tldr" : "When a user clicks a link with the `target=\"_blank\"` attribute, the linked page (target) opens in a new window or tab, which shares the same process as the original page. The `window.opener` object holds information about the original page that provided the link. If an attacker is able to run a script on the target page, they could potentially read or modify properties of the `window.opener` object, including the `location` property. This could allow the attacker to redirect the user to a malicious site, such as for phishing attacks, even if the original and target sites have different origins. Since the redirection occurs in the original window/tab, which may not be visible to the user, the user might not notice the suspicious redirection. However, modern browsers now automatically include `rel=\"noopener\"` for links with `target=\"_blank\"`, mitigating this vulnerability and reducing its severity.",
