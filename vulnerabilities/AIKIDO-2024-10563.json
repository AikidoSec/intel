  "tldr": "Version `2.1.0.31` of the Amazon Redshift JDBC Driver is vulnerable to SQL injection. This vulnerability allows attackers to escalate privileges by injecting malicious SQL into the `getSchemas`, `getTables`, or `getColumns` metadata APIs.  By manipulating schema input, an attacker can bypass access controls, retrieve unauthorized data, or modify database structures. This poses a significant risk to data integrity and confidentiality. Users are advised to upgrade to version `2.1.0.32`, which contains a fix for this issue. Alternatively, reverting to version `2.1.0.30` is a temporary mitigation until the latest version can be deployed.",
