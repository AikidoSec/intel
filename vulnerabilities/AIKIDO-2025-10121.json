  "tldr": "Affected versions of the `joserfc` library may be vulnerable because they rely on random values that are not generated with sufficient randomness in their `RFC 7516` implementation. `RFC 7516` specifies the use of authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) and requires cryptographically secure random values for key generation, nonces, and other components. If the random values are predictable or not adequately randomized, it could allow attackers to exploit weaknesses in the encryption process, potentially compromising the security of sensitive data. This vulnerability may lead to the exposure of plaintext or unauthorized access to encrypted information, undermining the integrity and confidentiality guarantees provided by the library.",
