  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL injection. The `whereIn` method in `Select` directly interpolates user-supplied values into the SQL string, allowing malicious input to modify the query and potentially access or manipulate data. This fix replaces unsafe string concatenation with proper parameter binding by adding each value to `$this->params` and generating database-safe placeholders via `Utilities::get_placeholder()`, ensuring the `WHERE IN` clause is fully parameterized and protected from injection attacks.",
