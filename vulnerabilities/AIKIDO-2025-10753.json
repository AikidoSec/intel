  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) attacks due to the use of inefficient regex-based parsing for inline formatting. Crafted markdown input could trigger excessive backtracking, leading to performance degradation or application hangs. The fix replaces the regex-based parser with a custom iterative scanner that runs in linear time and is immune to ReDoS attacks, while also improving handling of nested and escaped formatting.",
