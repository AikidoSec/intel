  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution due to unsafe `eval()` usage in `util.base.expr`. The vulnerability occurs when user-controlled inputs `s` are improperly sanitized before being embedded into a lambda expression string that is dynamically evaluated. An attacker can exploit this by injecting malicious Python code within the input string, which breaks out of the intended lambda `rec:context` and executes arbitrary commands with the application's privileges, potentially leading to system compromise or data exfiltration.",
