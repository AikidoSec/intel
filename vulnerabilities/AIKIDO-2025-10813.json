  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data: a gadget chain in Drupal core can be leveraged if the application deserializes attacker-controlled data. The chain itself is not directly exploitable but can enable remote code execution when a separate vulnerability allows unsafe input to reach `unserialize()`. There are no known exploits in Drupal core.",
