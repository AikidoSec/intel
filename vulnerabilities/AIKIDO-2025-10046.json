  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) through the `success_url` and `reject_url` parameters when requesting application passwords. An attacker can exploit this by injecting malicious web scripts into these parameters. If the attacker tricks a user into clicking a crafted link and then accepting or rejecting the application password, the injected script will execute in the user's browser. This could result in data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.",
