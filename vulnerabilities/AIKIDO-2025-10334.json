  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package fail to properly encode CSS selector expressions, allowing an attacker to inject malicious selectors (e.g., input[type='password']). Since quotes and special characters are not properly escaped, the injected selector breaks JavaScript execution, potentially causing application errors or enabling DOM exfiltration. If user-controlled input is passed directly into the selector, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser's instance.
