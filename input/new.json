  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package perform in-place modification of input tensors in the `functional_masked_fill!` implementation, which could lead to silent data corruption or unexpected behavior when functions that are intended to be non-destructive modify shared underlying memory. The patched version changes `functional_masked_fill!` to avoid modifying the original input tensor in place, preventing unintended side effects that could be exploited in complex tensor pipelines.",
