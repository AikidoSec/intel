  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Disclosure via Error Message due to improper error handling in the `handleError` function of `channelServiceRoutes`, which directly sends sensitive error traces (including stack details) in HTTP responses. This allows attackers to deliberately trigger errors and extract internal application logic, file paths, or system details by analyzing the verbose error messages, facilitating further exploits like targeted attacks or reconnaissance.",
