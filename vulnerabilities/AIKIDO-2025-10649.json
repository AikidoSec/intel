  "tldr": "`webpack-dev-server` allows users to use webpack with a development server that provides live reloading. Prior to version `5.2.1`, `webpack-dev-server` users' source code may be stolen when you access a malicious web site with non-Chromium based browser. The Origin header is checked to prevent Cross-site WebSocket hijacking from happening, which was reported by CVE-2018-14732. But `webpack-dev-server` always allows IP address Origin headers. This allows websites that are served on IP addresses to connect WebSocket. An attacker can obtain source code via a method similar to that used to exploit CVE-2018-14732. Version `5.2.1` contains a patch for the issue.",
