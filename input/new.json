  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication Bypass via unprotected static file endpoint due to improper access controls when serving static directories via the `--static-dirs` flag.

It occurs because the static file endpoint lacks authentication checks, exposing all files in the designated directory to unauthenticated users.",
