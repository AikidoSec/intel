  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to access bypass through insecure cors behavior: the module automatically enables CORS with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, overriding any existing `services.yml` settings and allowing any origin to make cross-origin requests without administrator approval. All installations are affected because this behavior cannot be disabled. Updating the module resolves the issue—upgrade to Next.js 2.0.1 for Drupal 10/11 or Next.js 1.6.4 for Drupal 9—and then review your CORS configuration in `sites/default/services.yml`, especially if you previously relied on the module’s automatic settings.",
