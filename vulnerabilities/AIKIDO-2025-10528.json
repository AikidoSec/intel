  "tldr": "Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to memory leaks caused by improper socket handling. When attempting to connect through a SOCKS proxy to a non-existent or non-responsive server, the package fails to properly close the socket, resulting in a leaked open connection. Over time, repeated failed connection attempts can exhaust system resources, potentially leading to degraded performance or application crashes.",
