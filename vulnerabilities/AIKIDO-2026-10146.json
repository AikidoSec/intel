  "tldr": "Affected versions of this package allow command injection during image build because user-controlled fields from the gadget manifest are interpolated into `Makefile.build` targets without proper escaping; specifically, parameters like `CFLAGS`, source paths, and other build options are passed directly to `make`. An attacker who can influence `build.yml` (e.g., in CI/CD pipelines building untrusted gadgets) can inject shell metacharacters to execute arbitrary commands during the build, resulting in code execution on the local host when `--local` is used, or inside the build container otherwise.",
